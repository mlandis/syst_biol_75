[SEP]   It is widely acknowledged that integrating fossils into data sets of extant taxa is imperative for proper placement of fossils, resolution of relationships, and a better understanding of character evolution. The importance of this process has been further magnified because of the crucial role of fossils in dating divergence times. Outstanding issues remain, including appropriate methods to place fossils in phylogenetic trees, the importance of molecules versus morphology in these analyses, as well as the impact of potentially large amounts of missing data for fossil taxa. In this study we used the angiosperm clade Juglandaceae as a model for investigating methods of integrating fossils into a phylogenetic framework of extant taxa. The clade has a rich fossil record relative to low extant diversity, as well as a robust molecular phylogeny and morphological database for extant taxa. After combining fossil organ genera into composite and terminal taxa, our objectives were to (1) compare multiple methods for the integration of the fossils and extant taxa (including total evidence, molecular scaffolds, and molecular matrix representation with parsimony [MRP]); (2) explore the impact of missing data (incomplete taxa and characters) and the evidence for placing fossils on the topology; (3) simulate the phylogenetic effect of missing data by creating ""artificial fossils""; and (4) place fossils and compare the impact of single and multiple fossil constraints in estimating the age of clades. Despite large and variable amounts of missing data, each of the methods provided reasonable placement of both fossils and simulated ""artificial fossils"" in the phylogeny previously inferred only from extant taxa. Our results clearly show that the amount of missing data in any given taxon is not by itself an operational guideline for excluding fossils from analysis. Three fossil taxa (Cruciptera simsonii, Paleoplatycarya wingii, and Platycarya americana) were placed within crown clades containing living taxa for which relationships previously had been suggested based on morphology, whereas Polyptera manningii, a mosaic taxon with equivocal affinities, was placed firmly as sister to two modern crown clades. The position of Paleooreomunnea stoneana was ambiguous with total evidence but conclusive with DNA scaffolds and MRP. There was less disturbance of relationships among extant taxa using a total evidence approach, and the DNA scaffold approach did not provide improved resolution or internal support for clades compared to total evidence, whereas weighted MRP retained comparable levels of support but lost crown clade resolution. Multiple internal minimum age constraints generally provided reasonable age estimates, but the use of single constraints provided by extinct genera tended to underestimate clade ages.', 'Sequential Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference.  [SEP]   The ideal approach to Bayesian phylogenetic inference is to estimate all parameters of interest jointly in a single hierarchical model. However, this is often not feasible in practice due to the high computational cost. Instead, phylogenetic pipelines generally consist of sequential analyses, whereby a single point estimate from a given analysis is used as input for the next analysis (e.g., a single multiple sequence alignment is used to estimate a gene tree). In this framework, uncertainty is not propagated from step to step, which can lead to inaccurate or spuriously confident results. Here, we formally develop and test a sequential inference approach for Bayesian phylogenetic inference, which uses importance sampling to generate observations for the next step of an analysis pipeline from the posterior distribution produced in the previous step. Our sequential inference approach presented here not only accounts for uncertainty between analysis steps but also allows for greater flexibility in software choice (and hence model availability) and can be computationally more efficient than the traditional joint inference approach when multiple models are being tested. We show that our sequential inference approach is identical in practice to the joint inference approach only if sufficient information in the data is present (a narrow posterior distribution) and/or sufficiently many important samples are used. Conversely, we show that the common practice of using a single point estimate can be biased, for example, a single phylogeny estimate can transform an unrooted phylogeny into a time-calibrated phylogeny. We demonstrate the theory of sequential Bayesian inference using both a toy example and an empirical case study of divergence-time estimation in insects using a relaxed clock model from transcriptome data. In the empirical example, we estimate 3 posterior distributions of branch lengths from the same data (DNA character matrix with a GTR+Gamma+I substitution model, an amino acid data matrix with empirical substitution models, and an amino acid data matrix with the PhyloBayes CAT-GTR model). Finally, we apply 3 different node-calibration strategies and show that divergence time estimates are affected by both the data source and underlying substitution process to estimate branch lengths as well as the node-calibration strategies. Thus, our new sequential Bayesian phylogenetic inference provides the opportunity to efficiently test different approaches for divergence time estimation, including branch-length estimation from other software.', 'The Devil In The Details: Interactions Between The Branch-Length Prior And Likelihood Model Affect Node Support And Branch Lengths In The Phylogeny Of The Psoraceae.  [SEP]   In popular use of Bayesian phylogenetics, a default branch-length prior is almost universally applied without knowing how a different prior would have affected the outcome. We performed Bayesian and maximum likelihood (ML) inference of phylogeny based on empirical nucleotide sequence data from a family of lichenized ascomycetes, the Psoraceae, the morphological delimitation of which has been controversial. We specifically assessed the influence of the combination of Bayesian branch-length prior and likelihood model on the properties of the Markov chain Monte Carlo tree sample, including node support, branch lengths, and taxon stability. Data included two regions of the mitochondrial ribosomal RNA gene, the internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene, and the protein-coding largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. Data partitioning was performed using Bayes\' factors, whereas the best-fitting model of each partition was selected using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Given the data and model, short Bayesian branch-length priors generate higher numbers of strongly supported nodes as well as short and topologically similar trees sampled from parts of tree space that are largely unexplored by the ML bootstrap. Long branch-length priors generate fewer strongly supported nodes and longer and more dissimilar trees that are sampled mostly from inside the range of tree space sampled by the ML bootstrap. Priors near the ML distribution of branch lengths generate the best marginal likelihood and the highest frequency of ""rogue"" (unstable) taxa. The branch-length prior was shown to interact with the likelihood model. Trees inferred under complex partitioned models are more affected by the stretching effect of the branch-length prior. Fewer nodes are strongly supported under a complex model given the same branch-length prior. Irrespective of model, internal branches make up a larger proportion of total tree length under the shortest branch-length priors compared with longer priors. Relative effects on branch lengths caused by the branch-length prior can be problematic to downstream phylogenetic comparative methods making use of the branch lengths. Furthermore, given the same branch-length prior, trees are on average more dissimilar under a simple unpartitioned model compared with a more complex partitioned models. The distribution of ML branch lengths was shown to better fit a gamma or Pareto distribution than an exponential one. Model adequacy tests indicate that the best-fitting model selected by the BIC is insufficient for describing data patterns in 5 of 8 partitions. More general substitution models are required to explain the data in three of these partitions, one of which also requires nonstationarity. The two mitochondrial ribosomal RNA gene partitions need heterotachous models. We found no significant correlations between, on the one hand, the amount of ambiguous data or the smallest branch-length distance to another taxon and, on the other hand, the topological stability of individual taxa. Integrating over several exponentially distributed means under the best-fitting model, node support for the family Psoraceae, including Psora, Protoblastenia, and the Micarea sylvicola group, is approximately 0.96. Support for the genus Psora is distinctly lower, but we found no evidence to contradict the current classification.']"

[SEP]   We conducted a phylogenetic study of pygopodid lizards, a group of 38 species endemic to Australia and New Guinea, with two major goals: to reconstruct a taxonomically complete and robustly supported phylogeny for the group and to use this information to gain insights into the tempo, mode, and timing of the pygopodid radiation. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), nuclear DNA (nDNA), and previously published morphological data using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods on the independent and combined three data sets yielded trees with similar and largely stable ingroup topologies. However, relationships among the six most inclusive and unambiguously supported clades (Aprasia, Delma, Lialis, Ophidiocephalus, Pletholax, and Pygopus) varied depending on data set analyzed. We used parametric bootstrapping to help us understand which of the three-branch schemes linking these six taxa was most plausible given our data. We conclude based on our results that the arrangement ((((Delma, Lialis)Pygopus)Pletholax)(Aprasia, Ophidiocephalus)) represents the best hypothesis of intergeneric relationships. A second major problem to arise in our study concerned the inability of our two outgroup taxa (Diplodactylus) to root trees properly; three different rooting locations were suggested depending upon analysis. This long-branch attraction problem was so severe that the outgroup branch also interfered with estimation of ingroup relationships. We therefore used the molecular clock method to root the pygopodid tree. Results of two independent molecular clock analyses (mtDNA and nDNA) converged upon the same root location (branch leading to Delma). We are confident that we have found the correct root because the possibility of our clock estimates agreeing by chance alone is remote given that there are 65 possible root locations (branches) on the pygopodid tree (approximately 1 in 65 odds). Our analysis also indicated that Delma fraseri is not monophyletic, a result supported by a parametric bootstrapping test. We elevated the Western Australian race, Delma f. petersoni, to species status (i.e., Delma petersoni) because hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting could be ruled out as potential causes of this paraphyletic gene tree and because D. grayii is broadly sympatric with its sister species D. fraseri. Climate changes over the past 23 million years, which transformed Australia from a wet, green continent to one that is largely dry and brown, have been suspected as playing a major role in the diversification of Australia's temperate biotas. Our phylogenetic analyses of pygopodid speciation and biogeography revealed four important findings consistent with this climate change diversification model: (1) our fossil-calibrated phylogeny shows that although some extant pygopodid lineages predate the onset of aridification, 28 of 33 pygopodid species included in our study seem to have originated in the last 23 million years; (2) relative cladogenesis tests suggest that several major clades underwent higher than expected rates of speciation; (3) our findings support earlier studies showing that speciation of mesic-adapted biotas in the southeastern and southwestern corners of Australia largely occurred within each of these regions between 12 and 23 million years ago as opposed to repeated dispersal between these regions; and (4) we have identified for the first time the existence of several pairs of sympatric sister species of lizards living in arid and semiarid ecosystems. These sympatric sister species seem to be younger than allopatric or parapatric sister-species pairs, which is not consistent with previous beliefs."", ""Is Homoplasy Or Lineage Sorting The Source Of Incongruent Mtdna And Nuclear Gene Trees In The Stiff-Tailed Ducks (Nomonyx-Oxyura)?.  [SEP]   We evaluated the potential effects of homoplasy, ancestral polymorphism, and hybridization as obstacles to resolving phylogenetic relationships within Nomonyx-Oxyura stiff-tailed ducks (Oxyurinae; subtribe Oxyurina). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences from 94 individuals supported monophyly of mtDNA haplotypes for each of the six species and provided no evidence of extant incomplete lineage sorting or inter-specific hybridization. The ruddy ducks (O. j. jamaicensis,O. j. andina, O. j. ferruginea) are each others' closest relatives, but the lack of shared haplotypes between O. j. jamaicensis and O. j. ferruginea suggests long-standing historical isolation. In contrast, O. j. andina shares haplotypes with O. j. jamaicensis and O. j. ferruginea, which supports Todd's (1979) and Fjeldså's (1986) hypothesis that O. j. andina is an intergrade or hybrid subspecies of O. j. jamaicensis and O. j. ferruginea. Control region data and a much larger data set composed of approximately 8800 base pairs of mitochondrial and nuclear sequence for each species indicate that the two New World species, O. vittata and O. jamaicensis, branch basally within Oxyura. A clade of three Old World species (O. australis, O. maccoa, O. leucocephala) is well supported, but different loci and also different characters within the mtDNA data support three different resolutions of the Old World clade, yielding an essentially unresolved trichotomy. Fundamentally different factors limited the resolution of the mtDNA and nuclear gene trees. Gene trees for most nuclear loci were unresolved due to slow rates of mutation and a lack of informative variation, whereas uncertain resolution of the mtDNA gene tree was due to homoplasy. Within the mtDNA, approximately equal numbers of characters supported each of three possible resolutions. Parametric and nonparametric bootstrap analyses suggest that resolution of the mtDNA tree based on ~4300 bp per taxon is uncertain but that complete mtDNA sequences would yield a fully resolved gene tree. A short internode separating O. leucocephala from (O. australis, O. maccoa) in the best mtDNA tree combined with long terminal branches and substantial rate variation among nucleotide sites allowed the small number of changes occurring on the internode to be obscured by homoplasy in a significant portion of simulated data sets. Although most nuclear loci were uninformative, two loci supported a resolution of the Old World clade (O. maccoa, O. leucocephala) that is incongruent with the best mtDNA tree. Thus, incongruence between nuclear and mtDNA trees may be due to random sorting of ancestral lineages during the short internode, homoplasy in the mtDNA data, or both. The Oxyura trichotomy represents a difficult though likely common problem in molecular systematics. Given a short internode, the mtDNA tree has a greater chance of being congruent with the history of speciation because its effective population size (N(e)) is one-quarter that of any nuclear locus, but its resolution is more likely to be obscured by homoplasy. In contrast, gene trees for more slowly evolving nuclear loci will be difficult to resolve due to a lack of substitutions during the internode, and when resolved are more likely to be incongruent with the species history due to the stochastic effects of lineage sorting. We suggest that researchers consider first whether independent gene trees are adequately resolved and then whether those trees are congruent with the species history. In the case of Oxyura, the answer to both questions may be no. Complete mtDNA sequences combined with data from a very large number of nuclear loci may be the only way to resolve such trichotomies."", 'Phylogeny And Temporal Diversification Of Darters (Percidae: Etheostomatinae).  [SEP]   Discussions aimed at resolution of the Tree of Life are most often focused on the interrelationships of major organismal lineages. In this study, we focus on the resolution of some of the most apical branches in the Tree of Life through exploration of the phylogenetic relationships of darters, a species-rich clade of North American freshwater fishes. With a near-complete taxon sampling of close to 250 species, we aim to investigate strategies for efficient multilocus data sampling and the estimation of divergence times using relaxed-clock methods when a clade lacks a fossil record. Our phylogenetic data set comprises a single mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene and two nuclear genes sampled from 245 of the 248 darter species. This dense sampling allows us to determine if a modest amount of nuclear DNA sequence data can resolve relationships among closely related animal species. Darters lack a fossil record to provide age calibration priors in relaxed-clock analyses. Therefore, we use a near-complete species-sampled phylogeny of the perciform clade Centrarchidae, which has a rich fossil record, to assess two distinct strategies of external calibration in relaxed-clock divergence time estimates of darters: using ages inferred from the fossil record and molecular evolutionary rate estimates. Comparison of Bayesian phylogenies inferred from mtDNA and nuclear genes reveals that heterospecific mtDNA is present in approximately 12.5% of all darter species. We identify three patterns of mtDNA introgression in darters: proximal mtDNA transfer, which involves the transfer of mtDNA among extant and sympatric darter species, indeterminate introgression, which involves the transfer of mtDNA from a lineage that cannot be confidently identified because the introgressed haplotypes are not clearly referable to mtDNA haplotypes in any recognized species, and deep introgression, which is characterized by species diversification within a recipient clade subsequent to the transfer of heterospecific mtDNA. The results of our analyses indicate that DNA sequences sampled from single-copy nuclear genes can provide appreciable phylogenetic resolution for closely related animal species. A well-resolved near-complete species-sampled phylogeny of darters was estimated with Bayesian methods using a concatenated mtDNA and nuclear gene data set with all identified heterospecific mtDNA haplotypes treated as missing data. The relaxed-clock analyses resulted in very similar posterior age estimates across the three sampled genes and methods of calibration and therefore offer a viable strategy for estimating divergence times for clades that lack a fossil record. In addition, an informative rank-free clade-based classification of darters that preserves the rich history of nomenclature in the group and provides formal taxonomic communication of darter clades was constructed using the mtDNA and nuclear gene phylogeny. On the whole, the appeal of mtDNA for phylogeny inference among closely related animal species is diminished by the observations of extensive mtDNA introgression and by finding appreciable phylogenetic signal in a modest sampling of nuclear genes in our phylogenetic analyses of darters.']"

[SEP]   In macroevolution, the Red Queen (RQ) model posits that biodiversity dynamics depend mainly on species-intrinsic biotic factors such as interactions among species or life-history traits, while the Court Jester (CJ) model states that extrinsic environmental abiotic factors have a stronger role. Until recently, a lack of relevant methodological approaches has prevented the unraveling of contributions from these 2 types of factors to the evolutionary history of a lineage. Herein, we take advantage of the rapid development of new macroevolution models that tie diversification rates to changes in paleoenvironmental (extrinsic) and/or biotic (intrinsic) factors. We inferred a robust and fully-sampled species-level phylogeny, as well as divergence times and ancestral geographic ranges, and related these to the radiation of Apollo butterflies (Parnassiinae) using both extant (molecular) and extinct (fossil/morphological) evidence. We tested whether their diversification dynamics are better explained by an RQ or CJ hypothesis, by assessing whether speciation and extinction were mediated by diversity-dependence (niche filling) and clade-dependent host-plant association (RQ) or by large-scale continuous changes in extrinsic factors such as climate or geology (CJ). For the RQ hypothesis, we found significant differences in speciation rates associated with different host-plants but detected no sign of diversity-dependence. For CJ, the role of Himalayan-Tibetan building was substantial for biogeography but not a driver of high speciation, while positive dependence between warm climate and speciation/extinction was supported by continuously varying maximum-likelihood models. We find that rather than a single factor, the joint effect of multiple factors (biogeography, species traits, environmental drivers, and mass extinction) is responsible for current diversity patterns and that the same factor might act differently across clades, emphasizing the notion of opportunity. This study confirms the importance of the confluence of several factors rather than single explanations in modeling diversification within lineages.', 'A Comparative Study In Ancestral Range Reconstruction Methods: Retracing The Uncertain Histories Of Insular Lineages.  [SEP]   Island systems have long been useful models for understanding lineage diversification in a geographic context, especially pertaining to the importance of dispersal in the origin of new clades. Here we use a well-resolved phylogeny of the flowering plant genus Cyrtandra (Gesneriaceae) from the Pacific Islands to compare four methods of inferring ancestral geographic ranges in islands: two developed for character-state reconstruction that allow only single-island ranges and do not explicitly associate speciation with range evolution (Fitch parsimony [FP; parsimony-based] and stochastic mapping [SM; likelihood-based]) and two methods developed specifically for ancestral range reconstruction, in which widespread ranges (spanning islands) are integral to inferences about speciation scenarios (dispersal-vicariance analysis [DIVA; parsimony-based] and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis [DEC; likelihood-based]). The methods yield conflicting results, which we interpret in light of their respective assumptions. FP exhibits the least power to unequivocally reconstruct ranges, likely due to a combination of having flat (uninformative) transition costs and not using branch length information. SM reconstructions generally agree with a prior hypothesis about dispersal-driven speciation across the Pacific, despite the conceptual mismatch between its character-based model and this mode of range evolution. In contrast with narrow extant ranges for species of Cyrtandra, DIVA reconstructs broad ancestral ranges at many nodes. DIVA results also conflict with geological information on island ages; we attribute these conflicts to the parsimony criterion not considering branch lengths or time, as well as vicariance being the sole means of divergence for widespread ancestors. DEC analyses incorporated geological information on island ages and allowed prior hypotheses about range size and dispersal rates to be evaluated in a likelihood framework and gave more nuanced inferences about range evolution and the geography of speciation than other methods tested. However, ancestral ranges at several nodes could not be conclusively resolved, due possibly to uncertainty in the phylogeny or the relative complexity of the underlying model. Of the methods tested, SM and DEC both converge on plausible hypotheses for area range histories in Cyrtandra, due in part to the consideration of branch lengths and/or timing of events. We suggest that DEC model-based methods for ancestral range inference could be improved by adopting a Bayesian SM approach, in which stochastic sampling of complete geographic histories could be integrated over alternative phylogenetic topologies. Likelihood-based estimates of ancestral ranges for Cyrtandra suggest a major dispersal route into the Pacific through the islands of Fiji and Samoa, motivating future biogeographic investigation of this poorly known region.', 'Integrating Fossils, Phylogenies, And Niche Models Into Biogeography To Reveal Ancient Evolutionary History: The Case Of Hypericum (Hypericaceae).  [SEP]   In disciplines such as macroevolution that are not amenable to experimentation, scientists usually rely on current observations to test hypotheses about historical events, assuming that ""the present is the key to the past."" Biogeographers, for example, used this assumption to reconstruct ancestral ranges from the distribution of extant species. Yet, under scenarios of high extinction rates, the biodiversity we observe today might not be representative of the historical diversity and this could result in incorrect biogeographic reconstructions. Here, we introduce a new approach to incorporate into biogeographic inference the temporal, spatial, and environmental information provided by the fossil record, as a direct evidence of the extinct biodiversity fraction. First, inferences of ancestral ranges for those nodes in the phylogeny calibrated with the fossil record are constrained to include the geographic distribution of the fossil. Second, we use fossil distribution and past climate data to reconstruct the climatic preferences and potential distribution of ancestral lineages over time, and use this information to build a biogeographic model that takes into account ""ecological connectivity"" through time. To show the power of this approach, we reconstruct the biogeographic history of the large angiosperm genus Hypericum, which has a fossil record extending back to the Early Cenozoic. Unlike previous reconstructions based on extant species distributions, our results reveal that Hypericum stem lineages were already distributed in the Holarctic before diversification of its crown-group, and that the geographic distribution of the genus has been relatively stable throughout the climatic oscillations of the Cenozoic. Geographical movement was mediated by the existence of climatic corridors, like Beringia, whereas the equatorial tropical belt acted as a climatic barrier, preventing Hypericum lineages to reach the southern temperate regions. Our study shows that an integrative approach to historical biogeography-that combines sources of evidence as diverse as paleontology, ecology, and phylogenetics-could help us obtain more accurate reconstructions of ancient evolutionary history. It also reveals the confounding effect different rates of extinction across regions have in biogeography, sometimes leading to ancestral areas being erroneously inferred as recent colonization events.']"

Since then, the relative number of marine to terrestrial species described per year has increased, reflecting the less explored nature of the oceans. From the mid-19th century, the cumulative number of species described has been linear, with the highest number of species described in the decade of 1900, and fewer species described and fewer authors active during the World Wars. There were more authors describing species since the 1960s, indicating greater taxonomic effort. There were fewer species described per author since the 1920s, suggesting it has become more difficult to discover new species. There was no evidence of any change in individual effort by taxonomists. Using a nonhomogeneous renewal process model we predicted that 24-31% to 21-29% more marine and terrestrial species remain to be discovered, respectively. We discuss why we consider that marine species comprise only 16% of all species on Earth although the oceans contain a greater phylogenetic diversity than occurs on land.

Their abundance can be attributed in large measure to their high success as parasites. This ability to parasitize appears to be a general characteristic of the phylum. It is not restricted to a single group of nematodes, and, in contradistinction to other phyla, few major nematode groups are either parasitic or free-living: almost every major group of nematodes includes some freeliving forms, some parasites, and some apparently becoming parasitic. Skrjabin\'s key (1949) illustrates this diversity: the members of many higher taxa are characterized as ""free-living, or parasites of plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates."" There appears to be no particular feature of the Nematoda which renders members of the phylum peculiarly or particularly preadapted to the parasitic life. Certainly the requirements for life in a plant root differ from those for life in the mammalian gut. Rather, nematodes seem generalized in structure (see Inglis, 1964) and genetically plastic.']"

[SEP]   Probabilistic tests of topology offer a powerful means of evaluating competing phylogenetic hypotheses. The performance of the nonparametric Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test, the parametric Swofford-Olsen-Waddell-Hillis (SOWH) test, and Bayesian posterior probabilities were explored for five data sets for which all the phylogenetic relationships are known with a very high degree of certainty. These results are consistent with previous simulation studies that have indicated a tendency for the SOWH test to be prone to generating Type 1 errors because of model misspecification coupled with branch length heterogeneity. These results also suggest that the SOWH test may accord overconfidence in the true topology when the null hypothesis is in fact correct. In contrast, the SH test was observed to be much more conservative, even under high substitution rates and branch length heterogeneity. For some of those data sets where the SOWH test proved misleading, the Bayesian posterior probabilities were also misleading. The results of all tests were strongly influenced by the exact substitution model assumptions. Simple models, especially those that assume rate homogeneity among sites, had a higher Type 1 error rate and were more likely to generate misleading posterior probabilities. For some of these data sets, the commonly used substitution models appear to be inadequate for estimating appropriate levels of uncertainty with the SOWH test and Bayesian methods. Reasons for the differences in statistical power between the two maximum likelihood tests are discussed and are contrasted with the Bayesian approach.', 'Branch-Length Prior Influences Bayesian Posterior Probability Of Phylogeny.  [SEP]   The Bayesian method for estimating species phylogenies from molecular sequence data provides an attractive alternative to maximum likelihood with nonparametric bootstrap due to the easy interpretation of posterior probabilities for trees and to availability of efficient computational algorithms. However, for many data sets it produces extremely high posterior probabilities, sometimes for apparently incorrect clades. Here we use both computer simulation and empirical data analysis to examine the effect of the prior model for internal branch lengths. We found that posterior probabilities for trees and clades are sensitive to the prior for internal branch lengths, and priors assuming long internal branches cause high posterior probabilities for trees. In particular, uniform priors with high upper bounds bias Bayesian clade probabilities in favor of extreme values. We discuss possible remedies to the problem, including empirical and full Bayesian methods and subjective procedures suggested in Bayesian hypothesis testing. Our results also suggest that the bootstrap proportion and Bayesian posterior probability are different measures of accuracy, and that the bootstrap proportion, if interpreted as the probability that the clade is true, can be either too liberal or too conservative.', ""Failed Refutations: Further Comments On Parsimony And Likelihood Methods And Their Relationship To Popper's Degree Of Corroboration.  [SEP]   Kluge's (2001, Syst. Biol. 50:322-330) continued arguments that phylogenetic methods based on the statistical principle of likelihood are incompatible with the philosophy of science described by Karl Popper are based on false premises related to Kluge's misrepresentations of Popper's philosophy. Contrary to Kluge's conjectures, likelihood methods are not inherently verificationist; they do not treat every instance of a hypothesis as confirmation of that hypothesis. The historical nature of phylogeny does not preclude phylogenetic hypotheses from being evaluated using the probability of evidence. The low absolute probabilities of hypotheses are irrelevant to the correct interpretation of Popper's concept termed degree of corroboration, which is defined entirely in terms of relative probabilities. Popper did not advocate minimizing background knowledge; in any case, the background knowledge of both parsimony and likelihood methods consists of the general assumption of descent with modification and additional assumptions that are deterministic, concerning which tree is considered most highly corroborated. Although parsimony methods do not assume (in the sense of entailing) that homoplasy is rare, they do assume (in the sense of requiring to obtain a correct phylogenetic inference) certain things about patterns of homoplasy. Both parsimony and likelihood methods assume (in the sense of implying by the manner in which they operate) various things about evolutionary processes, although violation of those assumptions does not always cause the methods to yield incorrect phylogenetic inferences. Test severity is increased by sampling additional relevant characters rather than by character reanalysis, although either interpretation is compatible with the use of phylogenetic likelihood methods. Neither parsimony nor likelihood methods assess test severity (critical evidence) when used to identify a most highly corroborated tree(s) based on a single method or model and a single body of data; however, both classes of methods can be used to perform severe tests. The assumption of descent with modification is insufficient background knowledge to justify cladistic parsimony as a method for assessing degree of corroboration. Invoking equivalency between parsimony methods and likelihood models that assume no common mechanism emphasizes the necessity of additional assumptions, at least some of which are probabilistic in nature. Incongruent characters do not qualify as falsifiers of phylogenetic hypotheses except under extremely unrealistic evolutionary models; therefore, justifications of parsimony methods as falsificationist based on the idea that they minimize the ad hoc dismissal of falsifiers are questionable. Probabilistic concepts such as degree of corroboration and likelihood provide a more appropriate framework for understanding how phylogenetics conforms with Popper's philosophy of science. Likelihood ratio tests do not assume what is at issue but instead are methods for testing hypotheses according to an accepted standard of statistical significance and for incorporating considerations about test severity. These tests are fundamentally similar to Popper's degree of corroboration in being based on the relationship between the probability of the evidence e in the presence versus absence of the hypothesis h, i.e., between p(e|hb) and p(e|b), where b is the background knowledge. Both parsimony and likelihood methods are inductive in that their inferences (particular trees) contain more information than (and therefore do not follow necessarily from) the observations upon which they are based; however, both are deductive in that their conclusions (tree lengths and likelihoods) follow necessarily from their premises (particular trees, observed character state distributions, and evolutionary models). For these and other reasons, phylogenetic likelihood methods are highly compatible with Karl Popper's philosophy of science and offer several advantages over parsimony methods in this context.""]"

[SEP]   Bayesian molecular dating is widely used to study evolutionary timescales. This procedure usually involves phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequence data, with fossil-based calibrations applied as age constraints on internal nodes of the tree. An alternative approach is tip-dating, which explicitly includes fossil data in the analysis. This can be done, for example, through the joint analysis of molecular data from present-day taxa and morphological data from both extant and fossil taxa. In the context of tip-dating, an important development has been the fossilized birth-death process, which allows non-contemporaneous tips and sampled ancestors while providing a model of lineage diversification for the prior on the tree topology and internal node times. However, tip-dating with fossils faces a number of considerable challenges, especially, those associated with fossil sampling and evolutionary models for morphological characters. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the performance of tip-dating using the fossilized birth-death model. We simulated fossil occurrences and the evolution of nucleotide sequences and morphological characters under a wide range of conditions. Our analyses of these data show that the number and the maximum age of fossil occurrences have a greater influence than the degree of among-lineage rate variation or the number of morphological characters on estimates of node times and the tree topology. Tip-dating with the fossilized birth-death model generally performs well in recovering the relationships among extant taxa but has difficulties in correctly placing fossil taxa in the tree and identifying the number of sampled ancestors. The method yields accurate estimates of the ages of the root and crown group, although the precision of these estimates varies with the probability of fossil occurrence. The exclusion of morphological characters results in a slight overestimation of node times, whereas the exclusion of nucleotide sequences has a negative impact on inference of the tree topology. Our results provide an overview of the performance of tip-dating using the fossilized birth-death model, which will inform further development of the method and its application to key questions in evolutionary biology.', 'Bayesian Phylogenetic Estimation Of Clade Ages Supports Trans-Atlantic Dispersal Of Cichlid Fishes.  [SEP]   Divergence-time estimation based on molecular phylogenies and the fossil record has provided insights into fundamental questions of evolutionary biology. In Bayesian node dating, phylogenies are commonly time calibrated through the specification of calibration densities on nodes representing clades with known fossil occurrences. Unfortunately, the optimal shape of these calibration densities is usually unknown and they are therefore often chosen arbitrarily, which directly impacts the reliability of the resulting age estimates. As possible solutions to this problem, two nonexclusive alternative approaches have recently been developed, the ""fossilized birth-death"" (FBD) model and ""total-evidence dating."" While these approaches have been shown to perform well under certain conditions, they require including all (or a random subset) of the fossils of each clade in the analysis, rather than just relying on the oldest fossils of clades. In addition, both approaches assume that fossil records of different clades in the phylogeny are all the product of the same underlying fossil sampling rate, even though this rate has been shown to differ strongly between higher level taxa. We here develop a flexible new approach to Bayesian age estimation that combines advantages of node dating and the FBD model. In our new approach, calibration densities are defined on the basis of first fossil occurrences and sampling rate estimates that can be specified separately for all clades. We verify our approach with a large number of simulated data sets, and compare its performance to that of the FBD model. We find that our approach produces reliable age estimates that are robust to model violation, on par with the FBD model. By applying our approach to a large data set including sequence data from over 1000 species of teleost fishes as well as 147 carefully selected fossil constraints, we recover a timeline of teleost diversification that is incompatible with previously assumed vicariant divergences of freshwater fishes. Our results instead provide strong evidence for transoceanic dispersal of cichlids and other groups of teleost fishes.', 'Inferring The Total-Evidence Timescale Of Marattialean Fern Evolution In The Face Of Model Sensitivity.  [SEP]   Phylogenetic divergence-time estimation has been revolutionized by two recent developments: 1) total-evidence dating (or ""tip-dating"") approaches that allow for the incorporation of fossils as tips in the analysis, with their phylogenetic and temporal relationships to the extant taxa inferred from the data and 2) the fossilized birth-death (FBD) class of tree models that capture the processes that produce the tree (speciation, extinction, and fossilization) and thus provide a coherent and biologically interpretable tree prior. To explore the behavior of these methods, we apply them to marattialean ferns, a group that was dominant in Carboniferous landscapes prior to declining to its modest extant diversity of slightly over 100 species. We show that tree models have a dramatic influence on estimates of both divergence times and topological relationships. This influence is driven by the strong, counter-intuitive informativeness of the uniform tree prior, and the inherent nonidentifiability of divergence-time models. In contrast to the strong influence of the tree models, we find minor effects of differing the morphological transition model or the morphological clock model. We compare the performance of a large pool of candidate models using a combination of posterior-predictive simulation and Bayes factors. Notably, an FBD model with epoch-specific speciation and extinction rates was strongly favored by Bayes factors. Our best-fitting model infers stem and crown divergences for the Marattiales in the mid-Devonian and Late Cretaceous, respectively, with elevated speciation rates in the Mississippian and elevated extinction rates in the Cisuralian leading to a peak diversity of ${\\sim}$2800 species at the end of the Carboniferous, representing the heyday of the Psaroniaceae. This peak is followed by the rapid decline and ultimate extinction of the Psaroniaceae, with their descendants, the Marattiaceae, persisting at approximately stable levels of diversity until the present. This general diversification pattern appears to be insensitive to potential biases in the fossil record; despite the preponderance of available fossils being from Pennsylvanian coal balls, incorporating fossilization-rate variation does not improve model fit. In addition, by incorporating temporal data directly within the model and allowing for the inference of the phylogenetic position of the fossils, our study makes the surprising inference that the clade of extant Marattiales is relatively young, younger than any of the fossils historically thought to be congeneric with extant species. This result is a dramatic demonstration of the dangers of node-based approaches to divergence-time estimation, where the assignment of fossils to particular clades is made a priori (earlier node-based studies that constrained the minimum ages of extant genera based on these fossils resulted in much older age estimates than in our study) and of the utility of explicit models of morphological evolution and lineage diversification.

[SEP]   Bayesian analysis of morphological data is becoming increasingly popular mainly (but not only) because it allows for time-calibrated phylogenetic inference using relaxed morphological clocks and tip dating whenever fossils are available. As with molecular data, recent studies have shown that modeling among-character rate variation (ACRV) in morphological matrices greatly improves phylogenetic inference. In a likelihood framework this may be accomplished, for instance, by employing a hidden Markov model to assign characters to rate categories drawn from a (discretized) $\\Gamma$ distribution and/or by partitioning data sets according to rate heterogeneity and estimating per-partition branch lengths, conditioned on a single topology. While the first approach is available in many phylogenetic analysis software, there is still no clear consensus on how to partition data, except perhaps in the simplest cases (e.g., ""by codon"" partitioning of coding sequences). Additionally, there is a trade-off between improvement in likelihood scores and the number of free parameters in the analysis, which rises quickly with the number of partitions. This trade-off may be dealt with by employing statistics that penalize overfitting of complex models, such as Akaike or Bayesian information criteria, or the more recently introduced stepping-stone method for marginal likelihood approximation. We applied the latter to three distinct matrices of discrete morphological data and demonstrated that sorting characters by homoplasy scores (obtained from implied weighting parsimony analysis) outperformed other partitioning strategies (anatomically-based and PartitionFinder2). The method was in fact so efficient in segregating characters by rates of evolution that no within-partition ACRV modeling was necessary, while among-partition rate variation was adequately accommodated by rate multipliers. We conclude that partitioning by homoplasy is a powerful and easy-to-implement strategy to address ACRV in complex data sets. We provide some guidelines focusing on morphological matrices, although this approach may be also applicable to molecular data sets.', 'Assessing The Adequacy Of Morphological Models Using Posterior Predictive Simulations.  [SEP]   Reconstructing the evolutionary history of different groups of organisms provides insight into how life originated and diversified on Earth. Phylogenetic trees are commonly used to estimate this evolutionary history. Within Bayesian phylogenetics a major step in estimating a tree is in choosing an appropriate model of character evolution. While the most common character data used is molecular sequence data, morphological data remains a vital source of information. The use of morphological characters allows for the incorporation fossil taxa, and despite advances in molecular sequencing, continues to play a significant role in neontology. Moreover, it is the main data source that allows us to unite extinct and extant taxa directly under the same generating process. We therefore require suitable models of morphological character evolution, the most common being the Mk Lewis model. While it is frequently used in both palaeobiology and neontology, it is not known whether the simple Mk substitution model, or any extensions to it, provide a sufficiently good description of the process of morphological evolution. In this study we investigate the impact of different morphological models on empirical tetrapod datasets. Specifically, we compare unpartitioned Mk models with those where characters are partitioned by the number of observed states, both with and without allowing for rate variation across sites and accounting for ascertainment bias. We show that the choice of substitution model has an impact on both topology and branch lengths, highlighting the importance of model choice. Through simulations, we validate the use of the model adequacy approach, posterior predictive simulations, for choosing an appropriate model. Additionally, we compare the performance of model adequacy with Bayesian model selection. We demonstrate how model selection approaches based on marginal likelihoods are not appropriate for choosing between models with partition schemes that vary in character state space (i.e., that vary in Q-matrix state size). Using posterior predictive simulations, we found that current variations of the Mk model are often performing adequately in capturing the evolutionary dynamics that generated our data. We do not find any preference for a particular model extension across multiple datasets, indicating that there is no ""one size fits all"" when it comes to morphological data and that careful consideration should be given to choosing models of discrete character evolution. By using suitable models of character evolution, we can increase our confidence in our phylogenetic estimates, which should in turn allow us to gain more accurate insights into the evolutionary history of both extinct and extant taxa.', ""More On The Best Evolutionary Rate For Phylogenetic Analysis.  [SEP]   The accumulation of genome-scale molecular data sets for nonmodel taxa brings us ever closer to resolving the tree of life of all living organisms. However, despite the depth of data available, a number of studies that each used thousands of genes have reported conflicting results. The focus of phylogenomic projects must thus shift to more careful experimental design. Even though we still have a limited understanding of what are the best predictors of the phylogenetic informativeness of a gene, there is wide agreement that one key factor is its evolutionary rate; but there is no consensus as to whether the rates derived as optimal in various analytical, empirical, and simulation approaches have any general applicability. We here use simulations to infer optimal rates in a set of realistic phylogenetic scenarios with varying tree sizes, numbers of terminals, and tree shapes. Furthermore, we study the relationship between the optimal rate and rate variation among sites and among lineages. Finally, we examine how well the predictions made by a range of experimental design methods correlate with the observed performance in our simulations.We find that the optimal level of divergence is surprisingly robust to differences in taxon sampling and even to among-site and among-lineage rate variation as often encountered in empirical data sets. This finding encourages the use of methods that rely on a single optimal rate to predict a gene's utility. Focusing on correct recovery either of the most basal node in the phylogeny or of the entire topology, the optimal rate is about 0.45 substitutions from root to tip in average Yule trees and about 0.2 in difficult trees with short basal and long-apical branches, but all rates leading to divergence levels between about 0.1 and 0.5 perform reasonably well.Testing the performance of six methods that can be used to predict a gene's utility against our simulation results, we find that the probability of resolution, signal-noise analysis, and Fisher information are good predictors of phylogenetic informativeness, but they require specification of at least part of a model tree. Likelihood quartet mapping also shows very good performance but only requires sequence alignments and is thus applicable without making assumptions about the phylogeny. Despite them being the most commonly used methods for experimental design, geometric quartet mapping and the integration of phylogenetic informativeness curves perform rather poorly in our comparison. Instead of derived predictors of phylogenetic informativeness, we suggest that the number of sites in a gene that evolve at near-optimal rates (as inferred here) could be used directly to prioritize genes for phylogenetic inference. In combination with measures of model fit, especially with respect to compositional biases and among-site and among-lineage rate variation, such an approach has the potential to greatly improve marker choice and should be tested on empirical data.""]"

[SEP]   The unwitting inclusion of convergent characters in phylogenetic estimates poses a serious problem for efforts to recover phylogeny. Convergence is not inscrutable, however, particularly when one group of characters tracks phylogeny and another set tracks adaptive history. In such cases, convergent characters may be correlated with one or a few functional anatomical units and readily identifiable by using comparative methods. Stifftail ducks (Oxyurinae) offer one such opportunity to study correlated character evolution and function in the context of phylogenetic reconstruction. Morphological analyses place stifftail ducks as part of a large clade of diving ducks that includes the sea ducks (Mergini), Hymenolaimus, Merganetta, and Tachyeres, and possibly the pochards (Aythyini). Molecular analyses, on the other hand, place stifftails far from other diving ducks and suggest, moreover, that stifftails are polyphyletic. Mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences of eight stifftail species traditionally supposed to form a clade were compared with each other and with sequences from 50 other anseriform and galliform species. Stifftail ducks are not the sister group of sea ducks but lie outside the typical ducks (Anatinae). Of the four traditional stifftail genera, monophyly of Oxyura and its sister group relationship with Nomonyx are strongly supported. Heteronetta probably is the sister group of that clade, but support is weak. Biziura is not a true stifftail. Within Oxyura, Old World species (O. australis, O. leucocephala, O. maccoa) appear to form a clade, with New World species (O. jamaicensis, O. vittata) branching basally. Incongruence between molecules and morphology is interpreted to be the result of adaptive specialization and functional convergence in the hind limbs of Biziura and true stifftails. When morphological characters are divided into classes, only hind-limb characters are significantly in conflict with the molecular tree. Likewise, null models of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution based on patterns of codon-degeneracy and chemical dissimilarity indicate that the nucleotide and amino acid changes postulated by the molecular tree are more plausible than those postulated by the morphological tree. These findings teach general lessons about the utility of highly adaptive characters (in particular those related to foraging ecology) and underscore the problems that convergence can pose for attempts to recover phylogeny. They also demonstrate how the concept of natural data partitions and simple models of evolution (e.g., parsimony, likelihood, neutrality) can be used to test the accuracy of independent phylogenetic estimates and provide arguments in favor of one tree topology over another.', 'Unraveling The Evolutionary Radiation Of The Thoracican Barnacles Using Molecular And Morphological Evidence: A Comparison Of Several Divergence Time Estimation Approaches.  [SEP]   The Thoracica includes the ordinary barnacles found along the sea shore and is the most diverse and well-studied superorder of Cirripedia. However, although the literature abounds with scenarios explaining the evolution of these barnacles, very few studies have attempted to test these hypotheses in a phylogenetic context. The few attempts at phylogenetic analyses have suffered from a lack of phylogenetic signal and small numbers of taxa. We collected DNA sequences from the nuclear 18S, 28S, and histone H3 genes and the mitochondrial 12S and 16S genes (4,871 bp total) and data for 37 adult and 53 larval morphological characters from 43 taxa representing all the extant thoracican suborders (except the monospecific Brachylepadomorpha). Four Rhizocephala (highly modified parasitic barnacles) taxa and a Rhizocephala + Acrothoracica (burrowing barnacles) hypothetical ancestor were used as the outgroup for the molecular and morphological analyses, respectively. We analyzed these data separately and combined using maximum likelihood (ML) under ""hill-climbing"" and genetic algorithm heuristic searches, maximum parsimony procedures, and Bayesian inference coupled with Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques under mixed and homogeneous models of nucleotide substitution. The resulting phylogenetic trees answered key questions in barnacle evolution. The four-plated Iblomorpha were shown as the most primitive thoracican, and the plateless Heteralepadomorpha were placed as the sister group of the Lepadomorpha. These relationships suggest for the first time in an invertebrate that exoskeleton biomineralization may have evolved from phosphatic to calcitic. Sessilia (nonpedunculate) barnacles were depicted as monophyletic and appear to have evolved from a stalked (pedunculate) multiplated (5+) scalpelloidlike ancestor rather than a five-plated lepadomorphan ancestor. The Balanomorpha (symmetric sessile barnacles) appear to have the following relationship: (Chthamaloidea(Coronuloidea(Tetraclitoidea, Balanoidea))). Thoracican divergence times were estimated under ML-based local clock, Bayesian, and penalized likelihood approaches using an 18S data set and three calibration points: Heteralepadomorpha = 530 million years ago (MYA), Scalpellomorpha = 340 MYA, and Verrucomorpha = 120 MYA. Estimated dates varied considerably within and between approaches depending on the calibration point. Highly parameterized local clock models that assume independent rates (r > or = 15) for confamilial or congeneric species generated the most congruent estimates among calibrations and agreed more closely with the barnacle fossil record. Reasonable estimates were also obtained under the Bayesian procedure of Kishino et al. (2001, Mol. Biol. Evol. 18:352-361) but using multiple calibrations. Most of the dates estimated under the Bayesian procedure of Aris-Brosou and Yang (2002, Syst. Biol. 51:703-714) and the penalized likelihood method using single and/or multiple calibrations were inconsistent among calibrations and did not fit the fossil record.', 'Phylogeny And Evolution Of Glass Sponges (Porifera, Hexactinellida).  [SEP]   Reconstructing the phylogeny of sponges (Porifera) is one of the remaining challenges to resolve the metazoan Tree of Life and is a prerequisite for understanding early animal evolution. Molecular phylogenetic analyses for two of the three extant classes of the phylum, Demospongiae and Calcarea, are largely incongruent with traditional classifications, most likely because of a paucity of informative morphological characters and high levels of homoplasy. For the third class, Hexactinellida (glass sponges)--predominantly deep-sea inhabitants with unusual morphology and biology--we present the first molecular phylogeny, along with a cladistic analysis of morphological characters. We collected 18S, 28S, and mitochondrial 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of 34 glass sponge species from 27 genera, 9 families, and 3 orders and conducted partitioned Bayesian analyses using RNA secondary structure-specific substitution models (paired-sites models) for stem regions. Bayes factor comparisons of different paired-sites models against each other and conventional (independent-sites) models revealed a significantly better fit of the former but, contrary to previous predictions, the least parameter-rich of the tested paired-sites models provided the best fit to our data. In contrast to Demospongiae and Calcarea, our rDNA phylogeny agrees well with the traditional classification and a previously proposed phylogenetic system, which we ascribe to a more informative morphology in Hexactinellida. We find high support for a close relationship of glass sponges and Demospongiae sensu stricto, though the latter may be paraphyletic with respect to Hexactinellida. Homoscleromorpha appears to be the sister group of Calcarea. Contrary to most previous findings from rDNA, we recover Porifera as monophyletic, although support for this clade is low under paired-sites models.']"

[SEP]   Recently, a suite of distance-based multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods has been proposed for studying the evolution of high-dimensional traits, such as morphometric coordinates, gene expression data, and function-valued traits. These methods allow for the statistical comparison of evolutionary rates, assessment of phylogenetic signal, and tests of correlated high-dimensional trait evolution. Simulations reveal that distance-based comparative methods exhibit low statistical power and high Type I error under various evolutionary scenarios. Distance-based methods are also limited to relatively simple model specification (e.g., Brownian motion evolution) due to the lack of a likelihood function for parameter estimation. Here I propose an alternative method for studying high-dimensional trait evolution which overcomes some of the statistical limitations associated with distance-based methods. This framework, based on parametric bootstrapping and maximum pseudolikelihood parameter estimation, opens up the ability to estimate alternative evolutionary models, combine multiple evolutionary hypotheses, and potentially allow missing data and within-species variation. Simulations reveal that pairwise composite likelihood methods demonstrate appropriate Type I error and high statistical power, thus providing a robust framework for studying high-dimensional trait evolution.

[SEP]   Many questions in evolutionary biology require the quantification and comparison of rates of phenotypic evolution. Recently, phylogenetic comparative methods have been developed for comparing evolutionary rates on a phylogeny for single, univariate traits (sigma-squared), and evolutionary rate matrices (R) for sets of traits treated simultaneously. However, high-dimensional traits like shape remain under-examined with this framework, because methods suited for such data have not been fully developed. In this article, I describe a method to quantify phylogenetic evolutionary rates for high-dimensional multivariate data (sigma-squared mult), found from the equivalency between statistical methods based on covariance matrices and those based on distance matrices (R-mode and Q-mode methods). I then use simulations to evaluate the statistical performance of hypothesis-testing procedures that compare sigma-squared mult for two or more groups of species on a phylogeny. Under both isotropic and non-isotropic conditions, and for differing numbers of trait dimensions, the proposed method displays appropriate Type I error and high statistical power for detecting known differences in sigma-squared mult among groups. In contrast, the Type I error rate of likelihood tests based on the evolutionary rate matrix (R) increases as the number of trait dimensions (p) increases, and becomes unacceptably large when only a few trait dimensions are considered. Further, likelihood tests based on R cannot be computed when the number of trait dimensions equals or exceeds the number of taxa in the phylogeny (i.e., when p >= N). These results demonstrate that tests based on sigma-squared mult provide a useful means of comparing evolutionary rates for high-dimensional data that are otherwise not analytically accessible to methods based on the evolutionary rate matrix. This advance thus expands the phylogenetic comparative toolkit for high-dimensional phenotypic traits like shape. Finally, I illustrate the utility of the new approach by evaluating rates of head shape evolution in a lineage of Plethodon salamanders.', 'Comparing Evolutionary Rates For Different Phenotypic Traits On A Phylogeny Using Likelihood.  [SEP]   In recent years, likelihood-based approaches have been used with increasing frequency to evaluate macroevolutionary hypotheses of phenotypic evolution under distinct evolutionary processes in a phylogenetic context (e.g., Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, etc.), and to compare one or more evolutionary rates for the same phenotypic trait along a phylogeny. It is also of interest to determine whether one trait evolves at a faster rate than another trait. However, to date no study has compared phylogenetic evolutionary rates between traits using likelihood, because a formal approach has not yet been proposed. In this article, I describe a new likelihood procedure for comparing evolutionary rates for two or more phenotypic traits on a phylogeny. This approach compares the likelihood of a model where each trait evolves at a distinct evolutionary rate to the likelihood of a model where all traits are constrained to evolve at a common evolutionary rate. The method can also account for within-species measurement error and within-species trait covariation if available. Simulations revealed that the method has appropriate Type I error rates and statistical power. Importantly, when compared with existing approaches based on phylogenetically independent contrasts and methods that compare confidence intervals for model parameters, the likelihood method displays preferable statistical properties for a wide range of simulated conditions. Thus, this likelihood-based method extends the phylogenetic comparative biology toolkit and provides evolutionary biologists with a more powerful means of determining when evolutionary rates differ between phenotypic traits. Finally, I provide an empirical example illustrating the approach by comparing rates of evolution for several phenotypic traits in Plethodon salamanders.']"

[SEP]   Biochemical constraints on the admissible amino acids at specific sites in proteins lead to heterogeneity of the amino acid substitution process over sites in alignments. It is well known that phylogenetic models of protein sequence evolution that do not account for site heterogeneity are prone to long-branch attraction (LBA) artifacts. Profile mixture models were developed to model heterogeneity of preferred amino acids at sites via a finite distribution of site classes each with a distinct set of equilibrium amino acid frequencies. However, it is unknown whether the large number of parameters in such models associated with the many amino acid frequency vectors can adversely affect tree topology estimates because of over-parameterization. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that for long sequences, over-parameterization does not create problems for estimation with profile mixture models. Under mild conditions, tree, amino acid frequencies, and other model parameters converge to true values as sequence length increases, even when there are large numbers of components in the frequency profile distributions. Because large sample theory does not necessarily imply good behavior for shorter alignments we explore the performance of these models with short alignments simulated with tree topologies that are prone to LBA artifacts. We find that over-parameterization is not a problem for complex profile mixture models even when there are many amino acid frequency vectors. In fact, simple models with few site classes behave poorly. Interestingly, we also found that misspecification of the amino acid frequency vectors does not lead to increased LBA artifacts as long as the estimated cumulative distribution function of the amino acid frequencies at sites adequately approximates the true one. In contrast, misspecification of the amino acid exchangeability rates can severely negatively affect parameter estimation. Finally, we explore the effects of including in the profile mixture model an additional ""F-class"" representing the overall frequencies of amino acids in the data set. Surprisingly, the F-class does not help parameter estimation significantly and can decrease the probability of correct tree estimation, depending on the scenario, even though it tends to improve likelihood scores.', 'Inferring Complex Dna Substitution Processes On Phylogenies Using Uniformization And Data Augmentation.  [SEP]   A new method is developed for calculating sequence substitution probabilities using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The basic strategy is to use uniformization to transform the original continuous time Markov process into a Poisson substitution process and a discrete Markov chain of state transitions. An efficient MCMC algorithm for evaluating substitution probabilities by this approach using a continuous gamma distribution to model site-specific rates is outlined. The method is applied to the problem of inferring branch lengths and site-specific rates from nucleotide sequences under a general time-reversible (GTR) model and a computer program BYPASSR is developed. Simulations are used to examine the performance of the new program relative to an existing program BASEML that uses a discrete approximation for the gamma distributed prior on site-specific rates. It is found that BASEML and BYPASSR are in close agreement when inferring branch lengths, regardless of the number of rate categories used, but that BASEML tends to underestimate high site-specific substitution rates, and to overestimate intermediate rates, when fewer than 50 rate categories are used. Rate estimates obtained using BASEML agree more closely with those of BYPASSR as the number of rate categories increases. Analyses of the posterior distributions of site-specific rates from BYPASSR suggest that a large number of taxa are needed to obtain precise estimates of site-specific rates, especially when rates are very high or very low. The method is applied to analyze 45 sequences of the alpha 2B adrenergic receptor gene (A2AB) from a sample of eutherian taxa. In general, the pattern expected for regions under negative selection is observed with third codon positions having the highest inferred rates, followed by first codon positions and with second codon positions having the lowest inferred rates. Several sites show exceptionally high substitution rates at second codon positions that may represent the effects of positive selection.', ""Mixture Models Of Nucleotide Sequence Evolution That Account For Heterogeneity In The Substitution Process Across Sites And Across Lineages.  [SEP]   Molecular phylogenetic studies of homologous sequences of nucleotides often assume that the underlying evolutionary process was globally stationary, reversible, and homogeneous (SRH), and that a model of evolution with one or more site-specific and time-reversible rate matrices (e.g., the GTR rate matrix) is enough to accurately model the evolution of data over the whole tree. However, an increasing body of data suggests that evolution under these conditions is an exception, rather than the norm. To address this issue, several non-SRH models of molecular evolution have been proposed, but they either ignore heterogeneity in the substitution process across sites (HAS) or assume it can be modeled accurately using the distribution. As an alternative to these models of evolution, we introduce a family of mixture models that approximate HAS without the assumption of an underlying predefined statistical distribution. This family of mixture models is combined with non-SRH models of evolution that account for heterogeneity in the substitution process across lineages (HAL). We also present two algorithms for searching model space and identifying an optimal model of evolution that is less likely to over- or underparameterize the data. The performance of the two new algorithms was evaluated using alignments of nucleotides with 10 000 sites simulated under complex non-SRH conditions on a 25-tipped tree. The algorithms were found to be very successful, identifying the correct HAL model with a 75% success rate (the average success rate for assigning rate matrices to the tree's 48 edges was 99.25%) and, for the correct HAL model, identifying the correct HAS model with a 98% success rate. Finally, parameter estimates obtained under the correct HAL-HAS model were found to be accurate and precise. The merits of our new algorithms were illustrated with an analysis of 42 337 second codon sites extracted from a concatenation of 106 alignments of orthologous genes encoded by the nuclear genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, S. castellii, S. kluyveri, S. bayanus, and Candida albicans. Our results show that second codon sites in the ancestral genome of these species contained 49.1% invariable sites, 39.6% variable sites belonging to one rate category (V1), and 11.3% variable sites belonging to a second rate category (V2). The ancestral nucleotide content was found to differ markedly across these three sets of sites, and the evolutionary processes operating at the variable sites were found to be non-SRH and best modeled by a combination of eight edge-specific rate matrices (four for V1 and four for V2). The number of substitutions per site at the variable sites also differed markedly, with sites belonging to V1 evolving slower than those belonging to V2 along the lineages separating the seven species of Saccharomyces. Finally, sites belonging to V1 appeared to have ceased evolving along the lineages separating S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. bayanus, implying that they might have become so selectively constrained that they could be considered invariable sites in these species.""]"

[SEP]   Chromosome banding techniques have been used in a large-scale survey of karyotypic variation within and between the chromosomal races of the Gehyra variegata-punctata species group. A total of nine chromosome races are now known among these taxa. G-banding confirms that the principal mode of chromosome change is centric fusion and, in most cases, allowed the specific chromosomes involved to be identified. The location of C-band heterochromatin and the nucleolar organizing region varied within and between the races. In two of the chromosome forms, heteromorphic sex chromosomes were observed in the early stages of evolution. The cytogenetic characters were evaluated and then used to construct a phylogeny for these taxa. The types of chromosome change between the races and their geographic relationships were then considered to examine the role of chromosomal mechanisms of speciation in these gekkos. The previously suggested role of single centric fusions as initiators of speciation in Gehyra requires further evaluation. In one case, an unusual form of tandem fusion has been established and this race is clearly reproductively isolated from all others. The presence of monobrachial homology between the biarmed chromosomes of some taxa suggests that a distinct mode of chromosomal speciation may also be important in Gehyra.', 'Chromosomal And Genetic Divergence In The Fossorial Lizards Of The Family Anniellidae.  [SEP]   Chromosomal divergence within the family Anniellidae is extensive. Diploid chromosome numbers in somatic tissue range from 36 in Anniella geronimensis to 22 in northern and 20 in southern A. pulchra. One to four testicular supernumerary microchromosomes occur in A. p. pulchra populations in northern Baja California. There is a lack of congruency between the chromosomal and morphological races of A. pulchra. Within the infraorder Anguimorpha, anniellids have chromosomal similarities to both the diploglossans (Anguidae) and the platynotans (Varanidae). The genetic distances between the four populations of Anniella analysed electrophoretically correspond well with their currently recognized hierarchical relationships: DN = .282-.298 between the two species, .104-. 119 between the two subspecies, and .003 between populations within subspecies. In comparison to other sympatric congeneric species of amphibians and reptiles, A. pulchra and A. geronimensis are only moderately divergent genetically. The genetic distance between populations of A. pulchra which differ in somatic karyotype is greater than that between the populations which differ only in supernumerary chromosomes. Allelic heterozygosity in populations of Anniella is notably low (ca. 1%). This low level of genetic variability and high level of chromosomal divergence accompanied by relatively few structural genomic changes appear to be important evolutionary correlates to the fossorial life-style of anniellid lizards.', 'Phylogenetic Analyses Of Chromosomal Banding Patterns Among The Nearctic Arvicolidae (Mammalia: Rodentia).  [SEP]   Numerical phylogenetic analyses of G-banded karyotypes were carried out for 22 species of arvicolids belonging to eight genera with diploid numbers among the species ranging from 18 to 64. Interspecific karyotypic comparisons indicate that 38 homologous autosomes or autosomal arms are shared by two or more species. The additional presence of 33 unique elements and 141 euchromatic rearrangements account for the extensive interspecific karyotypic variability. Ten different types of rearrangements were documented with centric fusion (27.0%), tandem fusion (14.2%) and pericentric inversion (12.8%) being the most abundant. Chromosomes and chromosomal rearrangements were quantitatively coded as present, absent, or missing in the karyotype of each species and the resulting data matrix (22 species by 214 karyotypic characters) subjected to cladistic analyses (with Peromyscus as an outgroup). Six analyses were executed where chromosomal rearrangements were weighted equal to or less than the weights assigned to entire chromosomes. Families of equally parsimonious trees were obtained and subsequently distilled into Adams-2 consensus estimates. Consistency indices ranged from 0.75 to 0.84 with reversals accounting for 2-30% of all homoplastic events. Systematically, Clethrionomys, Lemtnus, Synaptomys, Lagurus, Neofiber, and six species of Microtus share generally primitive autosomal complements; however, four derived characters suggest a relationship between M. ochrogaster and M. pinetorum. Six other species of Microtus (townsendii, pennsylvanicus, breweri, montanus, canicaudus and the more distant oregoni) share a number of derived characters. Dicrostonyx, Phenacomys, M. longicaudus, and M. oeconomus each possess a series of uniquely derived characters that tend to isolate these lineages. Chromosomal collocations support those derived from paleontology, comparative morphology, and protein electrophoresis in certain respects but not in others. Comparisons of zoogeographic distributions among four pairs of chromosomal sister taxa are interpreted to support an allopatric rather than a stasipatric (chromosomal) means of speciation in all cases except one.']"

[SEP]   Hundreds or thousands of loci are now routinely used in modern phylogenomic studies. Concatenation approaches to tree inference assume that there is a single topology for the entire dataset, but different loci may have different evolutionary histories due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), introgression, and/or horizontal gene transfer; even single loci may not be treelike due to recombination. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce an implementation of a multi-tree mixture model that we call mixtures across sites and trees (MAST). This model extends a prior implementation by Boussau et al. (2009) by allowing users to estimate the weight of each of a set of pre-specified bifurcating trees in a single alignment. The MAST model allows each tree to have its own weight, topology, branch lengths, substitution model, nucleotide or amino acid frequencies, and model of rate heterogeneity across sites. We implemented the MAST model in a maximum-likelihood framework in the popular phylogenetic software, IQ-TREE. Simulations show that we can accurately recover the true model parameters, including branch lengths and tree weights for a given set of tree topologies, under a wide range of biologically realistic scenarios. We also show that we can use standard statistical inference approaches to reject a single-tree model when data are simulated under multiple trees (and vice versa). We applied the MAST model to multiple primate datasets and found that it can recover the signal of ILS in the Great Apes, as well as the asymmetry in minor trees caused by introgression among several macaque species. When applied to a dataset of 4 Platyrrhine species for which standard concatenated maximum likelihood (ML) and gene tree approaches disagree, we observe that MAST gives the highest weight (i.e., the largest proportion of sites) to the tree also supported by gene tree approaches. These results suggest that the MAST model is able to analyze a concatenated alignment using ML while avoiding some of the biases that come with assuming there is only a single tree. We discuss how the MAST model can be extended in the future.', 'Species Trees From Gene Trees: Reconstructing Bayesian Posterior Distributions Of A Species Phylogeny Using Estimated Gene Tree Distributions.  [SEP]   The desire to infer the evolutionary history of a group of species should be more viable now that a considerable amount of multilocus molecular data is available. However, the current molecular phylogenetic paradigm still reconstructs gene trees to represent the species tree. Further, commonly used methods of combining data, such as the concatenation method, are known to be inconsistent in some circumstances. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the phylogeny of a group of species using multiple estimated gene tree distributions, such as those that arise in a Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence data. Our model employs substitution models used in traditional phylogenetics but also uses coalescent theory to explain genealogical signals from species trees to gene trees and from gene trees to sequence data, thereby forming a complete stochastic model to estimate gene trees, species trees, ancestral population sizes, and species divergence times simultaneously. Our model is founded on the assumption that gene trees, even of unlinked loci, are correlated due to being derived from a single species tree and therefore should be estimated jointly. We apply the method to two multilocus data sets of DNA sequences. The estimates of the species tree topology and divergence times appear to be robust to the prior of the population size, whereas the estimates of effective population sizes are sensitive to the prior used in the analysis. These analyses also suggest that the model is superior to the concatenation method in fitting these data sets and thus provides a more realistic assessment of the variability in the distribution of the species tree that may have produced the molecular information at hand. Future improvements of our model and algorithm should include consideration of other factors that can cause discordance of gene trees and species trees, such as horizontal transfer or gene duplication.', ""To Include Or Not To Include: The Impact Of Gene Filtering On Species Tree Estimation Methods.  [SEP]   With the increasing availability of whole genome data, many species trees are being constructed from hundreds to thousands of loci. Although concatenation analysis using maximum likelihood is a standard approach for estimating species trees, it does not account for gene tree heterogeneity, which can occur due to many biological processes, such as incomplete lineage sorting. Coalescent species tree estimation methods, many of which are statistically consistent in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting, include Bayesian methods that coestimate the gene trees and the species tree, summary methods that compute the species tree by combining estimated gene trees, and site-based methods that infer the species tree from site patterns in the alignments of different loci. Due to concerns that poor quality loci will reduce the accuracy of estimated species trees, many recent phylogenomic studies have removed or filtered genes on the basis of phylogenetic signal and/or missing data prior to inferring species trees; little is known about the performance of species tree estimation methods when gene filtering is performed. We examine how incomplete lineage sorting, phylogenetic signal of individual loci, and missing data affect the absolute and the relative accuracy of species tree estimation methods and show how these properties affect methods' responses to gene filtering strategies. In particular, summary methods (ASTRAL-II, ASTRID, and MP-EST), a site-based coalescent method (SVDquartets within PAUP*), and an unpartitioned concatenation analysis using maximum likelihood (RAxML) were evaluated on a heterogeneous collection of simulated multilocus data sets, and the following trends were observed. Filtering genes based on gene tree estimation error improved the accuracy of the summary methods when levels of incomplete lineage sorting were low to moderate but did not benefit the summary methods under higher levels of incomplete lineage sorting, unless gene tree estimation error was also extremely high (a model condition with few replicates). Neither SVDquartets nor concatenation analysis using RAxML benefited from filtering genes on the basis of gene tree estimation error. Finally, filtering genes based on missing data was either neutral (i.e., did not impact accuracy) or else reduced the accuracy of all five methods. By providing insight into the consequences of gene filtering, we offer recommendations for estimating species tree in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting and reconcile seemingly conflicting observations made in prior studies regarding the impact of gene filtering.""]"

[SEP]   Phylogenomic studies aim to build phylogenies from large sets of homologous genes. Such ""genome-sized"" data require fast methods, because of the typically large numbers of taxa examined. In this framework, distance-based methods are useful for exploratory studies and building a starting tree to be refined by a more powerful maximum likelihood (ML) approach. However, estimating evolutionary distances directly from concatenated genes gives poor topological signal as genes evolve at different rates. We propose a novel method, named super distance matrix (SDM), which follows the same line as average consensus supertree (ACS; Lapointe and Cucumel, 1997) and combines the evolutionary distances obtained from each gene into a single distance supermatrix to be analyzed using a standard distance-based algorithm. SDM deforms the source matrices, without modifying their topological message, to bring them as close as possible to each other; these deformed matrices are then averaged to obtain the distance supermatrix. We show that this problem is equivalent to the minimization of a least-squares criterion subject to linear constraints. This problem has a unique solution which is obtained by resolving a linear system. As this system is sparse, its practical resolution requires O(naka) time, where n is the number of taxa, k the number of matrices, and a < 2, which allows the distance supermatrix to be quickly obtained. Several uses of SDM are proposed, from fast exploratory studies to more accurate approaches requiring heavier computing time. Using simulations, we show that SDM is a relevant alternative to the standard matrix representation with parsimony (MRP) method, notably when the taxa sets of the different genes have low overlap. We also show that SDM can be used to build an excellent starting tree for an ML approach, which both reduces the computing time and increases the topogical accuracy. We use SDM to analyze the data set of Gatesy et al. (2002, Syst. Biol. 51: 652-664) that involves 48 genes of 75 placental mammals. The results indicate that these genes have strong rate heterogeneity and confirm the simulation conclusions.', ""Saté-Ii: Very Fast And Accurate Simultaneous Estimation Of Multiple Sequence Alignments And Phylogenetic Trees.  [SEP]   Highly accurate estimation of phylogenetic trees for large data sets is difficult, in part because multiple sequence alignments must be accurate for phylogeny estimation methods to be accurate. Coestimation of alignments and trees has been attempted but currently only SATé estimates reasonably accurate trees and alignments for large data sets in practical time frames (Liu K., Raghavan S., Nelesen S., Linder C.R., Warnow T. 2009b. Rapid and accurate large-scale coestimation of sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees. Science. 324:1561-1564). Here, we present a modification to the original SATé algorithm that improves upon SATé (which we now call SATé-I) in terms of speed and of phylogenetic and alignment accuracy. SATé-II uses a different divide-and-conquer strategy than SATé-I and so produces smaller more closely related subsets than SATé-I; as a result, SATé-II produces more accurate alignments and trees, can analyze larger data sets, and runs more efficiently than SATé-I. Generally, SATé is a metamethod that takes an existing multiple sequence alignment method as an input parameter and boosts the quality of that alignment method. SATé-II-boosted alignment methods are significantly more accurate than their unboosted versions, and trees based upon these improved alignments are more accurate than trees based upon the original alignments. Because SATé-I used maximum likelihood (ML) methods that treat gaps as missing data to estimate trees and because we found a correlation between the quality of tree/alignment pairs and ML scores, we explored the degree to which SATé's performance depends on using ML with gaps treated as missing data to determine the best tree/alignment pair. We present two lines of evidence that using ML with gaps treated as missing data to optimize the alignment and tree produces very poor results. First, we show that the optimization problem where a set of unaligned DNA sequences is given and the output is the tree and alignment of those sequences that maximize likelihood under the Jukes-Cantor model is uninformative in the worst possible sense. For all inputs, all trees optimize the likelihood score. Second, we show that a greedy heuristic that uses GTR+Gamma ML to optimize the alignment and the tree can produce very poor alignments and trees. Therefore, the excellent performance of SATé-II and SATé-I is not because ML is used as an optimization criterion for choosing the best tree/alignment pair but rather due to the particular divide-and-conquer realignment techniques employed."", 'Comparative Performance Of Supertree Algorithms In Large Data Sets Using The Soapberry Family (Sapindaceae) As A Case Study.  [SEP]   For the last 2 decades, supertree reconstruction has been an active field of research and has seen the development of a large number of major algorithms. Because of the growing popularity of the supertree methods, it has become necessary to evaluate the performance of these algorithms to determine which are the best options (especially with regard to the supermatrix approach that is widely used). In this study, seven of the most commonly used supertree methods are investigated by using a large empirical data set (in terms of number of taxa and molecular markers) from the worldwide flowering plant family Sapindaceae. Supertree methods were evaluated using several criteria: similarity of the supertrees with the input trees, similarity between the supertrees and the total evidence tree, level of resolution of the supertree and computational time required by the algorithm. Additional analyses were also conducted on a reduced data set to test if the performance levels were affected by the heuristic searches rather than the algorithms themselves. Based on our results, two main groups of supertree methods were identified: on one hand, the matrix representation with parsimony (MRP), MinFlip, and MinCut methods performed well according to our criteria, whereas the average consensus, split fit, and most similar supertree methods showed a poorer performance or at least did not behave the same way as the total evidence tree. Results for the super distance matrix, that is, the most recent approach tested here, were promising with at least one derived method performing as well as MRP, MinFlip, and MinCut. The output of each method was only slightly improved when applied to the reduced data set, suggesting a correct behavior of the heuristic searches and a relatively low sensitivity of the algorithms to data set sizes and missing data. Results also showed that the MRP analyses could reach a high level of quality even when using a simple heuristic search strategy, with the exception of MRP with Purvis coding scheme and reversible parsimony. The future of supertrees lies in the implementation of a standardized heuristic search for all methods and the increase in computing power to handle large data sets. The latter would prove to be particularly useful for promising approaches such as the maximum quartet fit method that yet requires substantial computing power.']"

[SEP]   In phylogenetic taxonomy, the clade denoted by a taxon name is determined by the phylogenetic definition of the name and by the phylogenetic context. The clade referred to by the phylogenetic definition of a taxon name depends on (1) the reference phylogeny, (2) the meanings of taxon names referred to in the definition, and (3) whether the name is defined as a node-, stem-, or apomorphy-based taxon. Ambiguity in the clade referred to by the definition results from (1) imprecise wording so that no single ancestor is specified, the clade identified by the definition changes with the extinction of taxa, or the definition is a tautology, (2) failure to specify a reference phylogeny, and (3) the lack of phylogenetic definitions of taxon names referred to in the definition. In phylogenetic taxonomy, phylogenetic pattern has the central role in determining the identity and attributes of the clades denoted by particular taxon names. Because phylogenetic definitions may associate taxon names with different clades on different cladograms, definitions may have to be emended with changes in our understanding of phylogeny to preserve the association between a taxon name and a particular clade. As phylogenetic hypotheses stabilize, so will the definitions and usage of taxon names. Conventions can promote universality in the formation, definition, and usage of taxon names in phylogenetic taxonomy. Ambiguity is reduced by using standard formats for node- and stem-based definitions and by citing authorities for the meaning of taxon names used in definitions. Reference to undefined taxon names in definitions can be avoided by referring instead to the species referred to that taxon in a standard taxonomic reference. Recommended usages of taxon names provide a mechanism for restricting the use of a name to a clade with a particular exclusive common ancestry. Continuity of usage should help to promote the acceptance of phylogenetic taxonomy by biologists. These issues are discussed within the context of the phylogenetic taxonomy of the Carnivora.', 'A Comparison Of Phylogenetic Nomenclature With The Current System: A Botanical Case Study.  [SEP]   The family Lamiaceae was used as a case study to compare our current system of nomenclature with a phylogenetic alternative proposed by de Queiroz and Gauthier (1992, Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 23:449-480), with emphasis on nomenclatural stability and efficiency. Comparison of published cladistic analyses revealed 19 suprageneric clades within Lamiaceae that are supported well enough to merit naming, but many genera could not be placed with confidence in any infrafamilial taxon. Two phylogenetic classifications were prepared, one following current nomenclatural rules and conventions and the other following the phylogenetic system of nomenclature. A comparison of the classifications revealed examples of unstable and ambiguous names that resulted from employing current rules and conventions to name clades. Old names based on nomenclatural types of uncertain phylogenetic relationship and infrafamilial taxon names based on the type of the family are particularly prone to instability. The phylogenetic system appears to have fewer problems but may also lead to nomenclatural confusion if taxon names are defined carelessly. The current system produces less efficient classifications because the principle of exhaustive subsidiary taxa leads to inclusion of redundant names (monotypic taxa) when the classification is based on an asymmetrical cladogram. In contrast, the phylogenetic system contains no redundant names. We endorse the recommendation that the principle of exhaustive subsidiary taxa be abandoned. Phylogenetic definitions should be provided for taxon names whenever phylogenies are translated into classifications. The definitions should be accompanied by a list of synapomorphies and a statement of clade membership to facilitate subsequent provisional referral of newly studied species to supraspecific taxa.', 'Replacement Of An Essentialistic Perspective On Taxonomic Definitions As Exemplified By The Definition Of \'Mammalia\'.  [SEP]   Current controversies about the definitions of taxon names reflect different underlying philosophical perspectives concerning the nature of definitions. The antithetical perspectives, called methodological essentialism and methodological nominalism (Popper, 1966, The open society and its enemies, Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, NJ), are exemplified by alternative views in a controversy surrounding the definition of the name ""Mammalia."" Traditional perspectives on the definition of ""Mammalia"" are essentialistic in that the definition takes the form of a description stated in terms of the traits of individual organisms, thus implying that taxa are abstract categories, i.e., that taxa have essences. In addition, the extension of the defined term (the set of species or organisms to which the name applies) is logically prior to its intension or defining formula (the property or properties that a species or organism must have to be designated by the name). Consequently, the name is treated as if it had a designation proper to it, which conforms with the essentialistic view that the name is an abbreviated description of the essence. An alternative perspective is manifested in the redefinition of ""Mammalia"" as the name of the monotreme and therian crown clade. This perspective contrasts with the traditional one in that the definition is stated in terms of common ancestry relationships rather than organismal traits, thus implying that taxa are concrete composite wholes rather than abstract categories. In addition, the defining formula is logically prior to the extension of the defined term, and thus the name is treated only as a convenient label or shorthand symbol for the defining formula that has no proper designation. The replacement of an essentialistic perspective on the definitions of ""Mammalia"" and other taxon names by a more nominalistic one is associated with the development of a phylogenetic perspective on biological nomenclature and represents an important step in the development of a more broadly scientific approach to that subject.']"

On the basis of their evolutionary relationships, these species can be assigned to 28 subgenera and 7 genera. In the phenetic study, 45 multistate, mostly qualitative characters were used to calculate correlation and distance coefficients; both similarity measures were clustered by the weighted pair-group method. Small clusters which formed at high similarity levels in the two phenograms were usually composed of species of one subgenus or two or three closely related subgenera. Major clusters in each of the phenograms, however, differed considerably both from those of the other phenogram and from the principal phylogenetic lineages (genera). ""Cophylogenetic coefficients,"" analogous to the cophenetic coefficients used in comparing phenograms, indicated that both phenograms poorly reflected inferred phylogeny and that they did not differ significantly with regard to their correspondence to the phylogenetic classification. Simple cluster analysis probably is adequate for finding phylogenetic groups at the subgeneric level but not for recognition of higher taxa. At the generic and higher levels, phenetic classifications are not more stable than phylogenetic ones. Phylogenetic classifications, being hypotheses about genealogy rather than static descriptions of morphological similarity, are more likely than phenetic ones to be productive of future investigations.', 'A Multivariate Assessment Of Phenetic Relationships Within The Feather Mite Family Eustathiidae (Acari).  [SEP]   Techniques of numerical taxonomy were applied in combination to morphometric data based on 111 characters from 61 OTUs, representing 61 species of the feather mite family Eustathiidae. Smaller subsets of taxa were analyzed to clarify the relationships and status of certain species. A statisfactory classification was obtained, complementing a monographic revision of the family in press. Supraspecific taxa were indicated by the placement of species on minimum spanning trees superimposed upon ordination diagrams. The latter were obtained by nonmetric multidimensional scaling applied to taxonomic distances. An initial configuration for multidimensional scaling was taken from a principal component analysis of character correlations. In every case except one the placement of species into genera by numerical methods matched our impressions of generic entities obtained by traditional approaches, although between- and within-generic relationships were clarified. The combination of Q- and R-mode analysis, including the use of nonmetric multidimensional scaling, provided an effective approach to the analysis of taxonomic structure. Multidimensional scaling is strongly recommended for similar studies as a technique to improve the accurate visual representation of taxonomic relationships. Only moderately strong host-parasite relationships occur within the Eustathiidae, although the group as a whole is restricted to the Apodi. No member of the Eustathiidae occurs on the other suborder of the Apodiformes, the Trochili. This emphasizes the distinction between Apodi and Trochili, and points again toward the question of whether or not these taxa of birds should be placed together. Host-parasite relationships within the Eustathiidae may be associated with resource tracking, but further data on feeding habits and life histories of the mites are needed to answer this question. Finally, this study represents a collaborative approach to the solution of a taxonomic problem. We feel that the collaborative approach has considerable potential in the resolution of difficult relationships within the Acari and other groups of organisms.

Using a total of 196 characters of the external and internal anatomy produced phenograms quite similar to the one arrived at by classical taxonomic techniques. There were, however, significant differences (e.g., relatively low similarity of the Papilionidae and Pieridae). Relationships based on most subsets of characters showed a ""family resemblance"" to one another and to the classical relationships. Relationships based on 96 internal and 100 external characters were compared by a randomization test. When evaluated by correlation coefficients the internal and external relationships were significantly different. When evaluated by distances they were not. Our results in general seem to support a ""weak"" version of the nonspecificity hypothesis-analysis of different large samples of characters ordinarily will yield positively correlated but non-identical patterns of relationship. This study has led to an appraisal of ideas of general classification and the utility of numerical taxonomy. Theoretical considerations make it seem unlikely that the idea of ""overall similarity"" has any validity. In any case it is clear that overall similarity cannot be dealt with operationally. All classifications are inherently special, and no one special classification is any more or less ""correct"" than any other. It is suggested that numerical taxonomy is a more sophisticated tool than is required for doing most routine taxonomic jobs. Numerical taxonomy, however, can be used in those situations where refined answers seem to be desirable, either where economic problems are involved or where light can be shed on general problems of population biology.']"

Thus, 21 groups of males (14 ""main"" samples, 2 samples one year apart, and 5 remeasured samples) and 14 groups of females were used in this study. Thirty-one measurements of skeletal characters were taken on 317 males and 142 females, plus on the 101 males that were remeasured. The main objective was to determine if phenotypic change had occurred over a half century, and to quantify the extent of such temporal change relative to levels and patterns of geographic variation. In the temporal samples, an average of 2.2 (7.1%) significant character differences per site was observed. Hence, most characters showed no significant differences over 50 years. Character differences between remeasured, temporal, and geographic samples were quantified by computing average percentage differences between character means. Taxonomic distances were computed between all pairs of samples (sexes separate). Ten characters were excluded from analyses due to relatively high levels of measurement error. Percentage differences for the remaining 21 character means for remeasured samples averaged 0.33 ¬± SD of 0.31% and resulted in an average taxonomic distance between replicates of 0.25. Average percentage differences in character means over 50 years (0.98 ¬± 0.79%) were similar to geographic differences (1.14 ¬± 0.88%) among samples taken during the same time period. Average taxonomic distance between samples taken 50 years apart (0.71 ¬± 0.21) was somewhat less than that between temporally comparable samples from different sites (0.84 ¬± 0.16). However, samples taken 50 years apart at a site can be as different as those from sites 100 to 200 km apart and assigned to different subspecies. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that temporal samples at two (of seven) sites differed significantly, and generalized discriminant analysis obtained significant differences between temporal samples at two additional sites. Temporal phenotypic stability was evident in that the same two groupings of samples were obtained in analyses of both old and new samples. However, patterns of variation in the two time periods, within these two main groupings of samples, are not concordant because of phenotypic change over time. That is, temporal change altered geographic patterns. Males and females showed different patterns of variation. No clear temporal trends in morphological change were identified, either in individual characters across sites, or in suites of characters within population samples. Characters with the largest relative differences over 50 years did not tend to show large geographic differences. The average taxonomic distance among old samples did not differ from that computed between recent samples; therefore, the populations at these sites are not diverging phenetically. Although the genetic basis of the phenotypic variation measured here is unknown, temporal variation could be adaptive either through phenotypic response to environmental change or by maintaining a store of morphological variability.', 'Morphological Variation And Evolution In Some North American Orioles.  [SEP]   Patterns of morphological variation of three taxa of orioles, Icterus galbula (Baltimore oriole), I. bullockii (Bullock oriole) and I. abeillei (black-backed oriole) (Icteridae; Aves) are discussed. Baltimore orioles breed in eastern North America, Bullock orioles in the western half of that Continent, and black-backed orioles on the Mexican Plateau. Distributional overlap is minimal. In most parts of their ranges individuals of either sex can be easily identified as to type by any of an array of features of size, color pattern, or vocalization. However, where the distributions of the morphs appear to abut, considerable phenetic variation is manifest. Special attention is here given to one such region of apparent abutment, the central Great Plains, where there is an abrupt east-to-west transition of Baltimore-morph to Bullock-morph and where some populations consist of orioles that are obviously phenetically intermediate. It has been suggested that the two forms are incipient bio-species, hybridizing in a geographically narrow region where secondary contacts have recently occurred. It is pointed out that step-clines of the sort manifest among Plains populations of orioles can arise by means other than secondary contact, and in the present context it seems unnecessarily speculative to postulate such rejunctions. On the basis of logical, distributional, and historical evidence, there is no reason to believe that the human activities of the past 150 years have had any fundamental effect on the distribution of the orioles in the Plains, and neither the incidence of phenetically intermediate individuals nor the width of the zone that essentially describes their distribution seems to be increasing. Rather, all evidence suggests that there is considerable stability among these populations, such that the patterns of distribution of the various morphs are coincident with some of those of the climatic environment. Doubtless many agencies of selection are acting in concert to dynamically maintain the ""steps"" in the oriole morph-clines in the Plains. Among these, the demonstrable difference between Baltimore and Bullock orioles\' high temperature tolerance must be of considerable significance. Also, the differences between the Baltimore- and Bullockmorphs are so great that birds that disperse across the ""hybrid zone"" are probably selected against as being ""unrecognizable"" or as ""odd birds."" It is impossible, within the described limits of non-phenetic concepts of the species, to designate as separate species or not these groups of orioles without relying upon a priori assumptions that are untenable or teleological, or without inviting a posteriori circularity. I have preferred nomenclatural separation for the groups for the sake of convenience, but such a decision is arbitrary.', ""Character Variation In Two Land Snails From The Dutch Leeward Islands: Geography, Environment And Evolution.  [SEP]   Cerion uva (L.) and Tudora megacheilos (Potiez and Michaud) are the dominant land snails of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao; both display the high degree of intraspecific character variation so often noted in terrestrial gastropods. This study correlates patterns of morphologic diversity with geographic and environmental distribution. Projected upon factor axes, the samples of each species fall into four groups corresponding to degrees of geographic isolation: Aruba, Bonaire, eastern and western Curaçao. Factor axes represent the major trends of variation in shell size and shape. Subgrouping within geographic clusters is influenced by environmental parameters. In Cerion, for example, shells collected from volcanic rocks tend to be larger than those from limestone. In all geographic regions, these volcanic samples are distinguished by their higher projection on an axis representing increased size and concomitant changes of shape. Pulmonates usually favor limestone, but the anomaly of Cerion's smaller size is related to the unfavorable climatic conditions associated with limestone areas in the Dutch West Indies (dry, windy, and poorly vegetated). If the morphologic differences among geographic regions are similar to ecologicallyinduced variation within regions, then interregional differences are probably adaptive, and not a fortuitous result of geographic isolation, as many have claimed. Cerion is small and Tudora large in eastern Curaçao; Tudora is small and Cerion large in western Curaçao. This interregional relationship is parallelled by significant negative correlations between sizes of the two species for samples within regions. Diversity patterns did not change significantly during 16 years separating the studies of Baker and Hummelinck. Baker's data show the same distinction of four geographic areas and similar patterns of distribution within areas; significant positive correlation exists between measures made by Baker and Hummelinck on samples collected from the same localities. Fossil samples from cave phosphates do not conform to modern distributions. The basic character diversity pattern-good (presumably genetic) distinction among regions and ecologically induced variation within regions-requires a revision of Baker's classification. Separate names for the four regions are warranted, but the cumbersome nomenclature for intraregional diversity should be dropped.""]"

[SEP]   Cross-species introgression can have significant impacts on phylogenomic reconstruction of species divergence events. Here, we used simulations to show how the presence of even a small amount of introgression can bias divergence time estimates when gene flow is ignored in the analysis. Using advances in analytical methods under the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model, we demonstrate that by accounting for incomplete lineage sorting and introgression using large phylogenomic data sets this problem can be avoided. The multispecies-coalescent-with-introgression (MSci) model is capable of accurately estimating both divergence times and ancestral effective population sizes, even when only a single diploid individual per species is sampled. We characterize some general expectations for biases in divergence time estimation under three different scenarios: 1) introgression between sister species, 2) introgression between non-sister species, and 3) introgression from an unsampled (i.e., ghost) outgroup lineage. We also conducted simulations under the isolation-with-migration (IM) model and found that the MSci model assuming episodic gene flow was able to accurately estimate species divergence times despite high levels of continuous gene flow. We estimated divergence times under the MSC and MSci models from two published empirical datasets with previous evidence of introgression, one of 372 target-enrichment loci from baobabs (Adansonia), and another of 1000 transcriptome loci from 14 species of the tomato relative, Jaltomata. The empirical analyses not only confirm our findings from simulations, demonstrating that the MSci model can reliably estimate divergence times but also show that divergence time estimation under the MSC can be robust to the presence of small amounts of introgression in empirical datasets with extensive taxon sampling.

[SEP]   Introgressive hybridization plays a key role in adaptive evolution and species diversification in many groups of species. However, frequent hybridization and gene flow between species make estimation of the species phylogeny and key population parameters challenging. Here, we show that by accounting for phasing and using full-likelihood methods, introgression histories and population parameters can be estimated reliably from whole-genome sequence data. We employ the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model with and without gene flow to infer the species phylogeny and cross-species introgression events using genomic data from six members of the erato-sara clade of Heliconius butterflies. The methods naturally accommodate random fluctuations in genealogical history across the genome due to deep coalescence. To avoid heterozygote phasing errors in haploid sequences commonly produced by genome assembly methods, we process and compile unphased diploid sequence alignments and use analytical methods to average over uncertainties in heterozygote phase resolution. There is robust evidence for introgression across the genome, both among distantly related species deep in the phylogeny and between sister species in shallow parts of the tree. We obtain chromosome-specific estimates of key population parameters such as introgression directions, times and probabilities, as well as species divergence times and population sizes for modern and ancestral species. We confirm ancestral gene flow between the sara clade and an ancestral population of Heliconius telesiphe, a likely hybrid speciation origin for Heliconius hecalesia, and gene flow between the sister species Heliconius erato and Heliconius himera. Inferred introgression among ancestral species also explains the history of two chromosomal inversions deep in the phylogeny of the group. This study illustrates how a full-likelihood approach based on the MSC makes it possible to extract rich historical information of species divergence and gene flow from genomic data.

[SEP]   A Bayesian coalescent-based method has recently been proposed to delimit species using multilocus genetic sequence data. Posterior probabilities of different species delimitation models are calculated using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The method accounts for species phylogenies and coalescent events in both extant and extinct species and accommodates lineage sorting and uncertainties in the gene trees. Although the method is theoretically appealing, its utility in practical data analysis is yet to be rigorously examined. In particular, the analysis may be sensitive to priors on ancestral population sizes and on species divergence times and to gene flow between species. Here we conduct a computer simulation to evaluate the statistical performance of the method, such as the false negatives (the error of lumping multiple species into one) and false positives (the error of splitting one species into several). We found that the correct species model was inferred with high posterior probability with only one or two loci when 5 or 10 sequences were sampled from each population, or with 50 loci when only one sequence was sampled. We also simulated data allowing migration under a two-species model, a mainland-island model and a stepping-stone model to assess the impact of gene flow (hybridization or introgression). The behavior of the method was diametrically different depending on the migration rate. Low rates at < 0.1 migrants per generation had virtually no effect, so that the method, while assuming no hybridization between species, identified distinct species despite small amounts of gene flow. This behavior appears to be consistent with biologists' practice. In contrast, higher migration rates at ‚â• 10 migrants per generation caused the method to infer one species. At intermediate levels of migration, the method is indecisive. Our results suggest that Bayesian analysis under the multispecies coalescent model may provide important insights into population divergences, and may be useful for generating hypotheses of species delimitation, to be assessed with independent information from anatomical, behavioral, and ecological data.""]"

[SEP]   Genetic sequence data provide information about the distances between species or branch lengths in a phylogeny, but not about the absolute divergence times or the evolutionary rates directly. Bayesian methods for dating species divergences estimate times and rates by assigning priors on them. In particular, the prior on times (node ages on the phylogeny) incorporates information in the fossil record to calibrate the molecular tree. Because times and rates are confounded, our posterior time estimates will not approach point values even if an infinite amount of sequence data are used in the analysis. In a previous study we developed a finite-sites theory to characterize the uncertainty in Bayesian divergence time estimation in analysis of large but finite sequence data sets under a strict molecular clock. As most modern clock dating analyses use more than one locus and are conducted under relaxed clock models, here we extend the theory to the case of relaxed clock analysis of data from multiple loci (site partitions). Uncertainty in posterior time estimates is partitioned into three sources: Sampling errors in the estimates of branch lengths in the tree for each locus due to limited sequence length, variation of substitution rates among lineages and among loci, and uncertainty in fossil calibrations. Using a simple but analogous estimation problem involving the multivariate normal distribution, we predict that as the number of loci ([Formula: see text]) goes to infinity, the variance in posterior time estimates decreases and approaches the infinite-data limit at the rate of 1/[Formula: see text], and the limit is independent of the number of sites in the sequence alignment. We then confirmed the predictions by using computer simulation on phylogenies of two or three species, and by analyzing a real genomic data set for six primate species. Our results suggest that with the fossil calibrations fixed, analyzing multiple loci or site partitions is the most effective way for improving the precision of posterior time estimation. However, even if a huge amount of sequence data is analyzed, considerable uncertainty will persist in time estimates.', 'An Evaluation Of Different Partitioning Strategies For Bayesian Estimation Of Species Divergence Times.  [SEP]   The explosive growth of molecular sequence data has made it possible to estimate species divergence times under relaxed-clock models using genome-scale data sets with many gene loci. In order to improve both model realism and to best extract information about relative divergence times in the sequence data, it is important to account for the heterogeneity in the evolutionary process across genes or genomic regions. Partitioning is a commonly used approach to achieve those goals. We group sites that have similar evolutionary characteristics into the same partition and those with different characteristics into different partitions, and then use different models or different values of model parameters for different partitions to account for the among-partition heterogeneity. However, how to partition data in practical phylogenetic analysis, and in particular in relaxed-clock dating analysis, is more art than science. Here, we use computer simulation and real data analysis to study the impact of the partition scheme on divergence time estimation. The partition schemes had relatively minor effects on the accuracy of posterior time estimates when the prior assumptions were correct and the clock was not seriously violated, but showed large differences when the clock was seriously violated, when the fossil calibrations were in conflict or incorrect, or when the rate prior was mis-specified. Concatenation produced the widest posterior intervals with the least precision. Use of many partitions increased the precision, as predicted by the infinite-sites theory, but the posterior intervals might fail to include the true ages because of the conflicting fossil calibrations or mis-specified rate priors. We analyzed a data set of 78 plastid genes from 15 plant species with serious clock violation and showed that time estimates differed significantly among partition schemes, irrespective of the rate drift model used. Multiple and precise fossil calibrations reduced the differences among partition schemes and were important to improving the precision of divergence time estimates. While the use of many partitions is an important approach to reducing the uncertainty in posterior time estimates, we do not recommend its general use for the present, given the limitations of current models of rate drift for partitioned data and the challenges of interpreting the fossil evidence to construct accurate and informative calibrations.', 'Inferring Speciation Times Under An Episodic Molecular Clock.  [SEP]   We extend our recently developed Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian estimation of species divergence times to allow variable evolutionary rates among lineages. The method can use heterogeneous data from multiple gene loci and accommodate multiple fossil calibrations. Uncertainties in fossil calibrations are described using flexible statistical distributions. The prior for divergence times for nodes lacking fossil calibrations is specified by use of a birth-death process with species sampling. The prior for lineage-specific substitution rates is specified using either a model with autocorrelated rates among adjacent lineages (based on a geometric Brownian motion model of rate drift) or a model with independent rates among lineages specified by a log-normal probability distribution. We develop an infinite-sites theory, which predicts that when the amount of sequence data approaches infinity, the width of the posterior credibility interval and the posterior mean of divergence times form a perfect linear relationship, with the slope indicating uncertainties in time estimates that cannot be reduced by sequence data alone. Simulations are used to study the influence of among-lineage rate variation and the number of loci sampled on the uncertainty of divergence time estimates. The analysis suggests that posterior time estimates typically involve considerable uncertainties even with an infinite amount of sequence data, and that the reliability and precision of fossil calibrations are critically important to divergence time estimation. We apply our new algorithms to two empirical data sets and compare the results with those obtained in previous Bayesian and likelihood analyses. The results demonstrate the utility of our new algorithms.']"

[SEP]   Disjunctive distributions across paleotropical regions in the Indian Ocean Basin (IOB) often invoke dispersal/vicariance debates. Exacum (Gentianaceae, tribe Exaceae) species are spread around the IOB, in Africa, Madagascar, Socotra, the Arabian peninsula, Sri Lanka, India, the Himalayas, mainland Southeast Asia including southern China and Malaysia, and northern Australia. The distribution of this genus was suggested to be a typical example of vicariance resulting from the breakup of the Gondwanan supercontinent. The molecular phylogeny of Exacum is in principle congruent with morphological conclusions and shows a pattern that resembles a vicariance scenario with rapid divergence among lineages, but our molecular dating analysis demonstrates that the radiation is too recent to be associated with the Gondwanan continental breakup. We used our dating analysis to test the results of DIVA and found that the program predicted impossible vicariance events. Ancestral area reconstruction suggests that Exacum originated in Madagascar, and divergence dating suggests its origin was not before the Eocene. The Madagascan progenitor, the most recent common ancestor of Exacum, colonized Sri Lanka and southern India via long-distance dispersals. This colonizer underwent an extensive range expansion and spread to Socotra-Arabia, northern India, and mainland Southeast Asia in the northern IOB when it was warm and humid in these regions. This widespread common ancestor retreated subsequently from most parts of these regions and survived in isolation in Socotra-Arabia, southern India-Sri Lanka, and perhaps mainland Southeast Asia, possibly as a consequence of drastic climatic changes, particularly the spreading drought during the Neogene. Secondary diversification from these surviving centers and Madagascar resulted in the extant main lineages of the genus. The vicariance-like pattern shown by the phylogeny appears to have resulted from long-distance dispersals followed by extensive range expansion and subsequent fragmentation. The extant African species E. oldenlandioides is confirmed to be recently dispersed from Madagascar.', 'Evolution At A Different Pace: Distinctive Phylogenetic Patterns Of Cone Snails From Two Ancient Oceanic Archipelagos.  [SEP]   Ancient oceanic archipelagos of similar geological age are expected to accrue comparable numbers of endemic lineages with identical life history strategies, especially if the islands exhibit analogous habitats. We tested this hypothesis using marine snails of the genus Conus from the Atlantic archipelagos of Cape Verde and Canary Islands. Together with Azores and Madeira, these archipelagos comprise the Macaronesia biogeographic region and differ remarkably in the diversity of this group. More than 50 endemic Conus species have been described from Cape Verde, whereas prior to this study, only two nonendemic species, including a putative species complex, were thought to occur in the Canary Islands. We combined molecular phylogenetic data and geometric morphometrics with bathymetric and paleoclimatic reconstructions to understand the contrasting diversification patterns found in these regions. Our results suggest that species diversity is even lower than previously thought in the Canary Islands, with the putative species complex corresponding to a single species, Conus guanche. One explanation for the enormous disparity in Conus diversity is that the amount of available habitat may differ, or may have differed in the past due to eustatic (global) sea level changes. Historical bathymetric data, however, indicated that sea level fluctuations since the Miocene have had a similar impact on the available habitat area in both Cape Verde and Canary archipelagos and therefore do not explain this disparity. We suggest that recurrent gene flow between the Canary Islands and West Africa, habitat losses due to intense volcanic activity in combination with unsuccessful colonization of new Conus species from more diverse regions, were all determinant in shaping diversity patterns within the Canarian archipelago. Worldwide Conus species diversity follows the well-established pattern of latitudinal increase of species richness from the poles towards the tropics. However, the eastern Atlantic revealed a striking pattern with two main peaks of Conus species richness in the subtropical area and decreasing diversities toward the tropical western African coast. A Random Forests model using 12 oceanographic variables suggested that sea surface temperature is the main determinant of Conus diversity either at continental scales (eastern Atlantic coast) or in a broader context (worldwide). Other factors such as availability of suitable habitat and reduced salinity due to the influx of large rivers in the tropical area also play an important role in shaping Conus diversity patterns in the western coast of Africa.', 'A Faunal History Of The North Atlantic Ocean.  [SEP]   Our modern, Northern Hemisphere boreal faunas apparently had a dual origin. In Paleocene-Eocene times, one cold-temperate evolutionary center probably became established in the Arctic Basin. Then, as the climate grew colder, another center south of the Bering Land Bridge began its development. During the Oligocene, boreal species were able to move out of the Arctic Basin into the North Atlantic and, in the Pacific, southward from the Bering Sea. By the late Miocene, when a seaway first became established through the Bering Strait, the movement of species was predominantly northward into the Arctic Ocean and thence to the North Atlantic. The second opening of the seaway in the late Pliocene had an even more striking result, transforming the character of the North Atlantic fauna yet scarcely affecting that of the North Pacific. In the contemporary North Atlantic, such characteristic features as a depauperate shore fauna; species with broad latitudinal ranges; the complete lack of an endemic, boreal pelagic group; and the very low rate of endemism at the oceanic islands; present a decided contrast to conditions in the North Pacific. These facts together with good evidence of Pleistocene faunal replacements, latitudinal shifts, and extinctions reveal that the North Atlantic has provided for its marine fauna a more rigorous environment than the North Pacific. It seems clear that alteration in temperature, the one evident variable, was the primary cause. It is concluded that the geographic setting of the North Atlantic with its open exposure to the Arctic Ocean and its relatively small size are the main factors responsible for its history of varied surface temperature. The most severe drops in temperature probably took place during the ice ages of the Pleistocene and these appear to have averaged about 3¬∞C below the present winter minimum. The shelf and pelagic surface fauna that becomes established under such conditions is vastly different, in terms of diversity and local geographic distribution, from a fauna occupying a more stable environment.']"

The process of converting an n x t table of test results into a t x t table of proximities between the pairs of items is called proximity analysis. The process of finding any isolated subsets of similar items is called cluster analysis. Taxometric methods are viewed as approaches to compressing the information in an n x t table into a graphic, best-fit model for the display of proximity and cluster relations among OTU's. Three general approaches are followed: 1) compression before proximity analysis, 2) compression as an intermediate step between proximity and cluster analysis, and 3) compression after cluster analysis. The utility of these approaches is compared. Taxometric maps are introduced as a means to display proximity and cluster relations. A procedure is given for preparing taxometric maps from cluster analysis results, and two examples are presented for illustration.

Simulation studies with minimum sample sizes of 25,000 indicated large and systematic changes in both the structure and the underlying distributions of data when ratios and proportions were compounded between continuous variables. Ratio variables are skewed to the right and leptokurtic and the nonnormality is increased when magnitude of the denominator coefficient of variation is increased. Further, there is a pronounced increase in spurious correlation between variables when ratios are compounded and the magnitude of this spurious correlation is a function of the size of the denominator coefficient of variation. This spurious correlation may increase from r = 0.0 between the original raw variables to r = 0.99 between the derived ratio variables. Multivariate statistical procedures such as principal components analysis are greatly affected when the data upon which the analyses are based include ratios or proportions. In this case, there is often an inflation of the first eigenvalue together with large changes in the magnitude and direction of the coefficients on the various principal components. Several common applications of ratios in biological research are discussed. Contrary to a widely held belief, it is shown that in the scaling of data, ratios do not remove the effect of the scaling variables but rather increase the correlation between the ratio variable and the original scaling variable.']"

[SEP]   In spite of the fact that the potential usefulness of bone histology in systematics has been discussed for over one and a half centuries, the presence of a phylogenetic signal in the variation of histological characters has rarely been assessed. A quantitative assessment of phylogenetic signal in bone histological characters could provide a justification for performing optimizations of these traits onto independently generated phylogenetic trees (as has been done in recent years). Here we present an investigation on the quantification of the phylogenetic signal in the following bone histological, microanatomical, and morphological traits in a sample of femora of 35 species of sauropsids: vascular density, vascular orientation, index of Haversian remodeling, cortical thickness, and cross-sectional area (bone size). For this purpose, we use two methods, regressions on distance matrices tested for significance using permutations (a Mantel test) and random tree length distribution. Within sauropsids, these bone microstructural traits have an optimal systematic value in archosaurs. In this taxon, a Mantel test shows that the phylogeny explains 81.8% of the variation of bone size and 86.2% of the variation of cortical thickness. In contrast, a Mantel test suggests that the phylogenetic signal in histological traits is weak: although the phylogeny explains 18.7% of the variation of vascular density in archosaurs, the phylogenetic signal is not significant either for vascular orientation or for the index of Haversian remodeling. However, Mantel tests seem to underestimate the proportion of variance of the dependent character explained by the phylogeny, as suggested by a PVR (phylogenetic eigenvector) analysis. We also deal with some complementary questions. First, we evaluate the functional dependence of bone vascular density on bone size by using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Second, we perform a variation partitioning analysis and show that the phylogenetic signal in bone vascular density is not a by-product of phylogentic signal in bone size. Finally, we analyze the evolution of cortical thickness in diapsids by using an optimization by squared change parsimony and discuss the functional significance of this character in terms of decreased buoyancy in crocodiles and mass saving in birds. These results are placed in the framework of the constructional morphology model, according to which the variation of a character in a clade has a historical (phylogenetic) component, a functional (adaptive) component, and a structural (architectural) component.', 'Are Modern Cryptic Species Detectable In The Fossil Record? A Case Study On Agamid Lizards.  [SEP]   Comparisons of extant and extinct biodiversity are often dependent on objective morphology-based identifications of fossils and assume a well-established and comparable taxonomy for both fossil and modern taxa. However, since many modern (cryptic) species are delimitated mainly via external morphology and / or molecular data, it is often unclear to what degree fossilized (osteological) remains allow classification to a similar level. When intraspecific morphological variation in extant taxa is poorly known, the definition of extinct species as well as the referral of fossils to extant species can be heavily biased, particularly if fossils are represented by incomplete isolated skeletal elements. This problem is especially pronounced in squamates (lizards and snakes) owing to a lack of osteological comparative knowledge for many lower taxonomic groups, concomitant with a recent increase of molecular studies revealing great cryptic diversity. Here, we apply a quantitative approach using 3D geometric morphometrics on 238 individuals of 14 genera of extant Australian and Papua New Guinean agamid lizards to test the value of two isolated skull bones (frontals and maxillae) for inferring taxonomic and ecological affinities. We further test for the consistency of intra- and interspecific morphological variability of these elements as a proxy for extinct taxonomic richness. We show that both bones are diagnostic at the generic level, and both can infer microhabitat and are of palaeoecological utility. However, species-level diversity is likely underestimated by both elements, with ~30-40% of species pairs showing no significant differences in shape. Mean intraspecific morphological variability is largely consistent across species and bones and thus a useful proxy for extinct species diversity. Reducing sample size and landmark completeness to approximate fossil specimens led to decreased classification accuracy and increased variance of morphological disparity, raising further doubts on the transferability of modern species borders to the fossil record of agamids. Our results highlight the need to establish appropriate levels of morphology-based taxonomic or ecological groupings prior to comparing extant and extinct biodiversity.', 'Variability Of Muskrat Skulls: Measurement Error, Environmental Modification And Size Allometry.  [SEP]   The biometrical consequences of measurement error, environmental effects caused by habitat quality, and effects of allometay transformation were studied in 22 morphometric traits of the skull of the muskrat, Ondatra zibethicus. Analyses were conducted at a regional level using four Finnish muskrat populations living 85-750 km apart, and at a local level using five subpopulations living 2-9 km apart in one Finnish lake. Only spring samples of animals born in the previous summer were used (n = 508), but sexes were pooled because they were not found to differ in variability. Reduced variability was found in traits connected with feeding. In larger variables the coefficient of variation (CV) was moderately negatively correlated with the mean, but in the smallest measurements the variability increased sharply. The dependence of the CV on the mean of the trait, thus, is hyperbolic. Corrected variabilities for each trait were calculated as the residuals from this function. Measurement error was estimated by repeated measurings of the same skulls, using two methods differing in acauracy. The proportion of measurement error in the CV varied from 3 to 23%, if measuring accuracy was 0.1 mm, and from 13 to 45%, if accuracy was only 0.5 mm (mean of the variables ranged from 4 to 63 mm). The proportion of measurement error in the CV increased with a decreasing mean value of the trait, but this cannot alone explain the great variability in the small traits. Environmental effects on variability were studied by grouping animals on the basis of their condition, classified by a growth index that measured body-weight gain per unit of molar wear. Improvement in animal condition decreased general morphological variability. We concluded that habitat quality, especially poor diet, was the main stress factor increasing variation, and specimens with the poorest condition were particularly exposed to this effect. In order to examine and compare allometric relationships on both a local and regional scale, each variable was divided by condylobasal length of the skull (CL; calculated by subtraction in log scale). If the corrected variability of a trait was lower or equal to that of CL, the transformation often induced a negative correlation with general size. In comparisons between local subpopulations, the effect of this bias was not serious: the allometric transformation reduced size differences that depend on habitat quality. If the correlation structure of the data was more heterogeneous, as in regional data, the transformation produced partly confusing results in univariaate and principal component analyses, but discriminant function analysis was not seriously affected.']"

The taxonomic relationships of the phenetic classification of Recent plus fossil forms can be explained by the amount of evolutionary change known to have occurred in given internodes. All but one of the mutually closest pairs in the phenogram are ancestor-descendant pairs. Gingerich\'s stratophenetic method yields a reasonably good estimated cladogram, but is misled by the occurrence of homoplasy in portions of the tree. Adding fossils improves estimates of the true cladogram based on the distance Wagner method but not estimates based on the Wagner parsimony algorithm. Estimated cladograms approach the true cladogram more closely than phenograms do, yet even the best estimate including the fossils has a strict consensus index no higher than 0.667. There are 10 characters that define genera. Their removal from the data base affects phenetic classifications slightly, cladistic classifications somewhat more. A cladistic classification of the Recent Caminalcules unnecessarily raises the ranks of some taxa. The less speciose and more symmetrical taxa emerge at lower taxonomic ranks than more speciose and asymmetrical taxa. Adding fossils to the Caminalcules requires a greater number of ranks for a cladistic than for a phenetic classification.', 'Otu Stability And Factors Determining Taxonomic Stability: Examples From The Caminalcules And The Leptopodomorpha.  [SEP]   Tests of OTU stability were carried out by random selection of subsets of OTUs from the Recent Caminalcules. From these samples we computed UPGMA phenograms and estimated cladograms based on Wagner parsimony and compatibility analysis. These were compared with pruned versions of the trees based on 29 OTUs representing: (1) their standards; and (2) the true cladogram known for this artificial data set. A similar analysis was carried out for a complete sampling of sets of OTUs from a data set based on the Leptopodomorpha (Hemiptera). Only the first type of comparison could be carried out for this data set. In the Caminalcules, when classifications based on samples of OTUs are compared with their own standards (classifications based on all OTUs)-which would be the typical situation in real organisms where true cladogenies are not known-stability seems to be a function of OTU sample size. For low OTU numbers, stability is higher in classifications based on estimated cladograms, but for high OTU numbers it is greater in classifications based on phenograms. While there is a trend towards increasing stability in the phenograms as OTU sample size increases, no such trend is evident in estimated cladograms of the standards or of the true cladogram. By contrast, estimated cladograms have a higher consensus with the true cladogram than do UPGMA phenograms regardless of number of OTUs employed. In the Leptopodomorpha, classifications based on UPGMA and Wagner parsimony methods are about equally stable with a suggestion of slightly better performance for Wagner parsimony at low OTU numbers and a reversal of this trend for higher OTU numbers. There is no evidence of marked superiority of Wagner parsimony as had been claimed in an earlier study of this group. The outcome of studies of both character and OTU stability is shown to be approximately related to the ratio n/(2t - 3), where n is the number of characters and t is the number of OTUs. When this ratio is low, phenograms are more stable than estimated cladograms; when it is high the reverse relation holds. Also, when the ratio is low, phenograms are better estimates of the true cladogeny than are estimated cladograms. The reverse relation holds for high values of the ratio. To confirm these conclusions, we carried out combined studies of character and of OTU stability applied to both data sets. As character number decreased, or OTU number increased, classifications based on phenograms became more stable than those based on estimated cladograms, and became better for reconstructing the true cladogeny than estimated cladograms in the Caminalcules. Character stability and OTU stability may in fact be two separate aspects of the same phenomenon-taxonomic stability. The merits of various designs suitable for testing OTU stability in numerical taxonomy are discussed. All are based on the results of sampling subsets of OTUs for the entire taxon. [Phenetic classifications; cladistic classifications; taxonomic stability; Caminalcules; Leptopodomorpha.]', 'A Phylogenetic Analysis Of The Caminalcules. Ii. Estimating The True Cladogram.  [SEP]   The ability of numerical methods to estimate the true cladogram is examined, using the Caminalcules as an example. This group of ""organisms"" was generated artificially according to principles believed to resemble those operating in real organisms. Estimated cladograms obtained by numerical methods are only moderately good estimates of the true cladogeny. Of the various models applied in numerical cladistics, the closeness of approximation to the true cladogeny is in the following order: best-Wagner parsimony and Camin-Sokal parsimony; second-polymorphism parsimony; third-character compatibility and Fitch\'s nonsequential method; fourth-UPGMA phenograms; worst-Dollo parsimony. Since the data matrix contains NC (no comparison) states, numerical cladistic algorithms that take account of these states give better results than those that do not. For distance Wagner algorithms, there is little difference in the outcome between midpoint rooting and rooting with a zero vector or with the true ancestor. By separate permutations of the order of the OTUs that are input to the numerical algorithm, trees of varying length were obtained from which the shortest could be chosen. Shortest trees, computed globally over all OTUs or separately for each Caminalcule genus, are not necessarily those that best estimate the true cladogeny. Numerical cladistic estimates separately computed for genera are poorer than those based on the entire taxon. The effects of homoplasy and divergence on the results of phenetic and cladistic algorithms are investigated in general and employed to explain in detail the differences among the true cladogram, the phenogram, and the estimated cladogram. The agreements observed are all in cases where given taxa diverge greatly from ancestral stems. Discrepancies are due to (A) parallelisms in the cladogeny affecting phenetic similarities and (B) divergence of cladistically close relatives increasing the relative phenetic similarity of cladistically more distant relatives. These two cases are about equally frequent.']"

[SEP]   Inferring phylogenies from gene frequencies should be regarded as a statistical problem rather than treated in the framework of the hypothetico-deductive method. The approximations involved in a statistical treatment are discussed, as are the models of gene frequency change implicit in the use of statistical methods. In particular, the different genetic distance statistics have different assumptions. These are pointed out, and a Markov chain treatment of genetic drift in a small population is used to evaluate the behavior of a number of the most popular genetic distances. Distance measures that are standardized to correct for the effect of initial gene frequencies behave as expected, but only for moderate amounts of time and when initial gene frequencies are not extreme. The distance measures such as those by Balakrishnan and Sanghvi and by Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards, which are standardized for the effect of the initial gene frequencies, perform acceptably if the initial gene frequencies are not too extreme and the divergence time is not larger than twice the effective population size. A genetic distance based on discrete character coding of alleles according to their presence or absence shows quite unusual behavior. No genetic distance copes very well with extreme initial gene frequencies. The prospect of getting useable additional information from population samples of sequences is also discussed. Criticisms by J. S. Farris of an earlier paper that used statistical criteria to evaluate parsimony and compatibility methods are rebutted.', ""Deriving Phylogenetic Trees From Allele Frequencies: A Comparison Of Nine Genetic Distances.

The derivation of such trees is defended as a parsimony procedure, and I conclude that any distance used in this procedure must be metric. The nine genetic distances are compared on the criteria of: metricity; ability to produce ancestral allele frequencies with heterozygosity approximating that of the terminal taxa; convergence to a stable solution; and computer time. The modified Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards' chord distance is equal or superior to the other distances on the first three criteria, but requires more computer time than most. Rogers' distance has the properties of metricity and convergence, and ranks below the modified chord distance on ancestral heterozygosity, but generally requires about one-half as much computer time as the modified chord distance."", ""A Comparison Of The Suitability Of The Rogers, Modified Rogers, Manhattan, And Cavalli-Sforza And Edwards Distances For Inferring Phylogenetic Trees From Allele Frequencies.

The theoretical considerations lead to the proposal of a new general criterion for choosing between cladograms or trees of equal length for qualitative characters as well when two trees are of equal length, the one that is consistent with more possible transformation series of the characters under consideration is preferable. Rogers's genetic distance also is shown to be less sensitive to the overestimation of distance produced by heterozygous loci and finite sample size than the Manhattan metric, Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards's distances, or Hillis's (1984, Syst.

[SEP]   Polyploidy is a significant mechanism in eukaryotic evolution and is particularly prevalent in the plant kingdom. However, our knowledge about this phenomenon and its effects on evolution remains limited. A major obstacle to the study of polyploidy is the great difficulty in untangling the origins of allopolyploids. Due to the drastic genome changes and the erosion of allopolyploidy signals caused by the combined effects of hybridization and complex postpolyploid diploidization processes, resolving the origins of allopolyploids has long been a challenging task. Here we revisit this issue with the interesting case of subtribe Tussilagininae (Asteraceae: Senecioneae) and by developing HomeoSorter, a new pipeline for network inferences by phasing homeologs to parental subgenomes. The pipeline is based on the basic idea of a previous study but with major changes to address the scaling problem and implement some new functions. With simulated data, we demonstrate that HomeoSorter works efficiently on genome-scale data and has high accuracy in identifying polyploid patterns and assigning homeologs. Using HomeoSorter, the maximum pseudo-likelihood model of Phylonet, and genome-scale data, we further address the complex origin of Tussilagininae, a speciose group (ca. 45 genera and 710 species) characterized by having high base chromosome numbers (mainly x‚+=‚+30, 40). In particular, the inferred patterns are strongly supported by the chromosomal evidence. Tussilagininae is revealed to comprise 2 large groups with successive allopolyploid origins: Tussilagininae s.s. (mainly x‚+=‚+30) and the Gynoxyoid group (x‚+=‚+40). Two allopolyploidy events first give rise to Tussilagininae s.s., with the first event occurring between the ancestor of subtribe Senecioninae (x‚+=‚+10) and a lineage (highly probably with x‚+=‚+10) related to the Brachyglottis alliance, and the resulting hybrid lineage crossing with the ancestor of Chersodoma (x‚+=‚+10) and leading to Tussilagininae s.s. Then, after early diversification, the Central American group (mainly x‚+=‚+30) of Tussilagininae s.s., is involved in a third allopolyploidy event with, again, the Chersodoma lineage and produces the Gynoxyoid group. Our study highlights the value of HomeoSorter and the homeolog-sorting approach in polyploid phylogenetics. With rich species diversity and clear evolutionary patterns, Tussilagininae s.s. and the Gynoxyoid group are also excellent models for future investigations of polyploidy.', 'Assignment Of Homoeologs To Parental Genomes In Allopolyploids For Species Tree Inference, With An Example From Fumaria (Papaveraceae).  [SEP]   There is a rising awareness that species trees are best inferred from multiple loci while taking into account processes affecting individual gene trees, such as substitution model error (failure of the model to account for the complexity of the data) and coalescent stochasticity (presence of incomplete lineage sorting [ILS]). Although most studies have been carried out in the context of dichotomous species trees, these processes operate also in more complex evolutionary histories involving multiple hybridizations and polyploidy. Recently, methods have been developed that accurately handle ILS in allopolyploids, but they are thus far restricted to networks of diploids and tetraploids. We propose a procedure that improves on this limitation by designing a workflow that assigns homoeologs to hypothetical diploid ancestral genomes prior to genome tree construction. Conflicting assignment hypotheses are evaluated against substitution model error and coalescent stochasticity. Incongruence that cannot be explained by stochastic mechanisms needs to be explained by other processes (e.g., homoploid hybridization or paralogy). The data can then be filtered to build multilabeled genome phylogenies using inference methods that can recover species trees, either in the face of substitution model error and coalescent stochasticity alone, or while simultaneously accounting for hybridization. Methods are already available for folding the resulting multilabeled genome phylogeny into a network. We apply the workflow to the reconstruction of the reticulate phylogeny of the plant genus Fumaria (Papaveraceae) with ploidal levels ranging from 2[Formula: see text] to 14[Formula: see text]. We describe the challenges in recovering nuclear NRPB2 homoeologs in high ploidy species while combining in vivo cloning and direct sequencing techniques. Using parametric bootstrapping simulations we assign nuclear homoeologs and chloroplast sequences (four concatenated loci) to their common hypothetical diploid ancestral genomes. As these assignments hinge on effective population size assumptions, we investigate how varying these assumptions impacts the recovered multilabeled genome phylogeny.', 'From Gene Trees To A Dated Allopolyploid Network: Insights From The Angiosperm Genus Viola (Violaceae).  [SEP]   Allopolyploidization accounts for a significant fraction of speciation events in many eukaryotic lineages. However, existing phylogenetic and dating methods require tree-like topologies and are unable to handle the network-like phylogenetic relationships of lineages containing allopolyploids. No explicit framework has so far been established for evaluating competing network topologies, and few attempts have been made to date phylogenetic networks. We used a four-step approach to generate a dated polyploid species network for the cosmopolitan angiosperm genus Viola L. (Violaceae Batch.). The genus contains ca 600 species and both recent (neo-) and more ancient (meso-) polyploid lineages distributed over 16 sections. First, we obtained DNA sequences of three low-copy nuclear genes and one chloroplast region, from 42 species representing all 16 sections. Second, we obtained fossil-calibrated chronograms for each nuclear gene marker. Third, we determined the most parsimonious multilabeled genome tree and its corresponding network, resolved at the section (not the species) level. Reconstructing the ""correct"" network for a set of polyploids depends on recovering all homoeologs, i.e., all subgenomes, in these polyploids. Assuming the presence of Viola subgenome lineages that were not detected by the nuclear gene phylogenies (""ghost subgenome lineages"") significantly reduced the number of inferred polyploidization events. We identified the most parsimonious network topology from a set of five competing scenarios differing in the interpretation of homoeolog extinctions and lineage sorting, based on (i) fewest possible ghost subgenome lineages, (ii) fewest possible polyploidization events, and (iii) least possible deviation from expected ploidy as inferred from available chromosome counts of the involved polyploid taxa. Finally, we estimated the homoploid and polyploid speciation times of the most parsimonious network. Homoploid speciation times were estimated by coalescent analysis of gene tree node ages. Polyploid speciation times were estimated by comparing branch lengths and speciation rates of lineages with and without ploidy shifts. Our analyses recognize Viola as an old genus (crown age 31 Ma) whose evolutionary history has been profoundly affected by allopolyploidy. Between 16 and 21 allopolyploidizations are necessary to explain the diversification of the 16 major lineages (sections) of Viola, suggesting that allopolyploidy has accounted for a high percentage-between 67% and 88%-of the speciation events at this level. The theoretical and methodological approaches presented here for (i) constructing networks and (ii) dating speciation events within a network, have general applicability for phylogenetic studies of groups where allopolyploidization has occurred. They make explicit use of a hitherto underexplored source of ploidy information from chromosome counts to help resolve phylogenetic cases where incomplete sequence data hampers network inference. Importantly, the coalescent-based method used herein circumvents the assumption of tree-like evolution required by most techniques for dating speciation events.']"

[SEP]   Albumin was purified from blood plasma and the FL isoenzyme of lactic dehydrogenase was purified from heart tissue of the lizard Iguana iguana. The purified proteins behaved as single components upon gel electrophoresis. They were injected into rabbits. The resulting antisera were tested for reactivity with unpurified preparations of albumin and heart lactic dehydrogenase from more than 50 other species. Reactivity was detected qualitatively by immunodiffusion tests and quantitatively by micro-complement fixation tests. Antisera against iguana Ht lactic dehydrogenase reacted strongly with the heart lactic dehydrogenases of other lizards as well as with those of snakes. The heart lactic dehydrogenases of the ""living fossil"" Sphenodon, crocodilians, turtles and birds reacted weakly. No reaction was detected with amphibian or mammalian heart lactic dehydrogenases. Antisera against iguana albumin reacted strongly with those of iguanine species, less strongly with those of other iguanid species and weakly, if at all, with those of non-iguanid lizards and snakes. Thus, by immunological criteria, albumin evolves faster than the H4 enzyme. Quantitative studies suggest that the immunological properties of albumin have changed about twice as fast as those of LDH during lizard evolution. Furthermore, lactic dehydrogenase appears to have evolved in a less regular fashion than has albumin. The quantitative immunological comparisons also demonstrate that as much albumin evolution has gone on in the family Iguanidae as in the mammalian orders Primates or Carnivora. Since lizard families, according to the fossil record, are approximately as old as orders of placental mammals it appears that albumin evolution has been proceeding at about the same rate in iguanids as in primates and carnivores. Similar studies were conducted with rabbit antisera prepared against purified alligator albumin. The results of cross-reactivity studies with the albumins of other crocodilians fit with the suggestion that rate of albumin evolution in crocodilians has been similar to that in iguanids, primates and carnivores.', 'Albumin Evolution And Organismal Evolution In Tree Frogs (Hylidae).  [SEP]   To explore the relationship between organismal and protein evolution, a comparative study was made of the serum albumins of tree frogs (Hylidae). Attention was centered on those Holarctic hylines whose anatomy and way of life have been intensively studied, namely species of Acris, Hyla, and Pseudacris. An albumin phylogeny was constructed from immunological distance data obtained with rabbit antisera to the purified albumins of 12 hyline species by means of the micro-complement fixation test. An analogous study with antisera to purified hemoglobin from 4 of these species was in approximate agreement with the albumin phylogeny. The albumin phylogeny revealed an apparent case of convergent morphological evolution involving H. wrightorum and H. regilla. These two species are similar enough in external morphology to have been classified in the same species by some recent authors. Yet their albumins differ as much from each other immunologically as from Acris albumin. This case is discussed more fully elsewhere (Maxson & Wilson, 1974). Discrepancies between organismal resemblance and albumin resemblance can also arise because of unequal rates of organismal divergence. Acris provides an example of this. The albumin phylogeny, supported by hemoglobin evidence, shows that the Acris lineage falls cladistically within the North American assemblage of Hyla lineages. Acris is more similar at the protein level to some Hyla species than the latter are to other Hyla species. Yet Acris is very different from Hyla in anatomy and way of life. The Acris lineage evidently underwent unusually rapid organismal evolution. However, there is no indication of accelerated albumin evolution in this lineage. Limnaoedus and Pseudacris provide additional examples of this sort. We infer that organismal and protein evolution can proceed at independent rates. This provides taxonomists with a dilemma: Should classifications be revised on the basis of protein data? The albumin results are consistent with recent ideas about the historical biogeography of hyline tree frogs. By assuming that albumin behaves as an evolutionary clock, which evolves at the rate of 1.7 immunological distance units per million years, it is calculated that a) Australian hylines diverged from New World hylines about 75 million years ago, b) North American hylines diverged from South American hylines 65 million years ago, and c) Eurasian hylines diverged from North American hylines about 40 million years ago. These estimated times are in approximate agreement with non-molecular evidence concerning the times when land connections existed between these continents. The assumed rate of albumin evolution is similar to that estimated elsewhere for such diverse organisms as mammals, iguanid lizards, crocodilians and ranoid frogs. The inference that albumin behaves approximately as an evolutionary clock is thus extended to include tree frogs.', 'Albumin Differences Among Ranid Frogs: Taxonomic And Phylogenetic Implications.  [SEP]   Since morphological analysis of living and fossil material has provided little information on taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships among species in the frog family Ranidae, an attempt was made to obtain such information by comparing their serum albumins. Rabbit antisera were prepared against the purified serum albumins of seven ranid species and tested by the microcomplement fixation method for reactivity with the albumins of 36 ranid species. This method provides a measure of the degree of amino acid sequence difference between albumins. The taxonomic and phylogenetic schemes we have derived from the albumin comparisons are generally in agreement with nonmolecular evidence. In some cases, they go beyond it, permitting demarcations among taxa that were previously unresolved. For example, it is proposed that the North American species of Rana are divisible into at least two major subgroups; an eastern subgroup, which includes R. pipiens and R. catesbeiana, and a western cluster, which includes R. aurora. The nearest relatives of the western cluster appear from albumin comparisons to be the R. temporaria cluster of the Palearctic region. The albumin results also permitted the construction of a phylogenetic tree with a very low percent standard deviation. With the aid of this tree and the molecular clock hypothesis we have estimated the approximate divergence times of various groups, subgroups and clusters of Holarctic ranid species. The molecular differences among Rana species are at least as large as those usually found within orders of placental mammals. This raises an important question regarding the ranking of taxonomic categories. If the genus Rana is equivalent in terms of genetic dispersion to an order of mammals, should one elevate the rank of Rana to the ordinal level? We believe that the molecular findings provide taxonomists with a dilemma.']"

[SEP]   Adaptive radiation is thought to be responsible for the evolution of a great portion of the past and present diversity of life. Instances of adaptive radiation, characterized by the rapid emergence of an array of species as a consequence to their adaptation to distinct ecological niches, are important study systems in evolutionary biology. However, because of the rapid lineage formation in these groups, and occasional gene flow between the participating species, it is often difficult to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of species that underwent an adaptive radiation. In this study, we present a novel approach for species-tree estimation in rapidly diversifying lineages, where introgression is known to occur, and apply it to a multimarker data set containing up to 16 specimens per species for a set of 45 species of East African cichlid fishes (522 individuals in total), with a main focus on the cichlid species flock of Lake Tanganyika. We first identified, using age distributions of most recent common ancestors in individual gene trees, those lineages in our data set that show strong signatures of past introgression. This led us to formulate three hypotheses of introgression between different lineages of Tanganyika cichlids: the ancestor of Boulengerochromini (or of Boulengerochromini and Bathybatini) received genomic material from the derived H-lineage; the common ancestor of Cyprichromini and Perissodini experienced, in turn, introgression from Boulengerochromini and/or Bathybatini; and the Lake Tanganyika Haplochromini and closely related riverine lineages received genetic material from Cyphotilapiini. We then applied the multispecies coalescent model to estimate the species tree of Lake Tanganyika cichlids, but excluded the lineages involved in these introgression events, as the multispecies coalescent model does not incorporate introgression. This resulted in a robust species tree, in which the Lamprologini were placed as sister lineage to the H-lineage (including the Eretmodini), and we identify a series of rapid splitting events at the base of the H-lineage. Divergence ages estimated with the multispecies coalescent model were substantially younger than age estimates based on concatenation, and agree with the geological history of the Great Lakes of East Africa. Finally, we formally tested the three hypotheses of introgression using a likelihood framework, and find strong support for introgression between some of the cichlid tribes of Lake Tanganyika.', ""Phylogenomic And Population Genomic Analyses Of Ultraconserved Elements Reveal Deep Coalescence And Introgression Shaped Diversification Patterns In Lamprologine Cichlids Of The Congo River.  [SEP]   Understanding the drivers of diversification is a central goal in evolutionary biology but can be challenging when lineages radiate quickly and/or hybridize frequently. Cichlids in the tribe Lamprologini, an exceptionally diverse clade found in the Congo basin, exemplify these issues: their evolutionary history has been difficult to untangle with previous datasets, particularly with regard to river-dwelling lineages in the genus Lamprologus. This clade notably includes the only known blind and depigmented cichlid, L. lethops. Here, we reconstructed the evolutionary, population, and biogeographic history of a Lamprologus clade from the Congo River by leveraging genomic data and sampling over 50 lamprologine species from the entire Lake Tanganyika radiation. This study provides the most comprehensive species-level coverage to date of the riverine taxa within this lacustrine-origin clade. We found that in the mid-late Pliocene, two lineages of Lake Tanganyika lamprologines independently colonized the Congo River, where they subsequently hybridized and diversified, forming the current monophyletic group of riverine Lamprologus. Our estimates for divergence time and introgression align with the region's geological history and suggest rapid speciation in Lamprologus species from the Congo River marked by rapids-driven vicariance and water level fluctuations, and repeated episodes of secondary contact and reticulation. As a result of our analyses, we propose the taxonomic restriction of the genus Lamprologus to Congo River taxa only. The complex evolutionary history of this group-characterized by introgressive hybridization followed by a rapid series of isolation and reconnection-illustrates the multifaceted dynamics of speciation that have shaped the rich biodiversity of this region.

[SEP]   Pleistocene climatic fluctuations (PCF) are frequently highlighted as important evolutionary engines that triggered cycles of biome expansion and contraction. Although there is ample evidence of the impact of PCF on biodiversity of continental biomes, the consequences in insular systems depend on the geology of the islands and the ecology of the taxa inhabiting them. The idiosyncratic aspects of insular systems are exemplified by the islands of the Sunda Shelf in Southeast Asia (Sundaland), where PCF-induced eustatic fluctuations had complex interactions with the geology of the region, resulting in high species diversity and endemism. Emergent land in Southeast Asia varied drastically with sea-level fluctuations during the Pleistocene. Climate-induced fluctuations in sea level caused temporary connections between insular and continental biodiversity hotspots in Southeast Asia. These exposed lands likely had freshwater drainage systems that extended between modern islands: the Paleoriver Hypothesis. Built upon the assumption that aquatic organisms are among the most suitable models to trace ancient river boundaries and fluctuations of landmass coverage, the present study aims to examine the evolutionary consequences of PCF on the dispersal of freshwater biodiversity in Southeast Asia. Time-calibrated phylogenies of DNA-delimited species were inferred for six species-rich freshwater fish genera in Southeast Asia (Clarias, Channa, Glyptothorax, Hemirhamphodon, Dermogenys, Nomorhamphus). The results highlight rampant cryptic diversity and the temporal localization of most speciation events during the Pleistocene, with 88% of speciation events occurring during this period. Diversification analyses indicate that sea-level-dependent diversification models poorly account for species proliferation patterns for all clades excepting Channa. Ancestral area estimations point to Borneo as the most likely origin for most lineages, with two waves of dispersal to Sumatra and Java during the last 5 myr. Speciation events are more frequently associated with boundaries of the paleoriver watersheds, with 60%, than islands boundaries, with 40%. In total, one-third of speciation events are inferred to have occurred within paleorivers on a single island, suggesting that habitat heterogeneity and factors other than allopatry between islands substantially affected diversification of Sundaland fishes. Our results suggest that species proliferation in Sundaland is not wholly reliant on Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations isolating populations on different islands.

[SEP]   Phylogenetic analyses using concatenation of genomic-scale data have been seen as the panacea for resolving the incongruences among inferences from few or single genes. However, phylogenomics may also suffer from systematic errors, due to the, perhaps cumulative, effects of saturation, among-taxa compositional (GC content) heterogeneity, or codon-usage bias plaguing the individual nucleotide loci that are concatenated. Here, we provide an example of how these factors affect the inferences of the phylogeny of early land plants based on mitochondrial genomic data. Mitochondrial sequences evolve slowly in plants and hence are thought to be suitable for resolving deep relationships. We newly assembled mitochondrial genomes from 20 bryophytes, complemented these with 40 other streptophytes (land plants plus algal outgroups), compiling a data matrix of 60 taxa and 41 mitochondrial genes. Homogeneous analyses of the concatenated nucleotide data resolve mosses as sister-group to the remaining land plants. However, the corresponding translated amino acid data support the liverwort lineage in this position. Both results receive weak to moderate support in maximum-likelihood analyses, but strong support in Bayesian inferences. Tests of alternative hypotheses using either nucleotide or amino acid data provide implicit support for their respective optimal topologies, and clearly reject the hypotheses that bryophytes are monophyletic, liverworts and mosses share a unique common ancestor, or hornworts are sister to the remaining land plants. We determined that land plant lineages differ in their nucleotide composition, and in their usage of synonymous codon variants. Composition heterogeneous Bayesian analyses employing a nonstationary model that accounts for variation in among-lineage composition, and inferences from degenerated nucleotide data that avoid the effects of synonymous substitutions that underlie codon-usage bias, again recovered liverworts being sister to the remaining land plants but without support. These analyses indicate that the inference of an early-branching moss lineage based on the nucleotide data is caused by convergent compositional biases. Accommodating among-site amino acid compositional heterogeneity (CAT-model) yields no support for the optimal resolution of liverwort as sister to the rest of land plants, suggesting that the robust inference of the liverwort position in homogeneous analyses may be due in part to compositional biases among sites. All analyses support a paraphyletic bryophytes with hornworts composing the sister-group to tracheophytes. We conclude that while genomic data may generate highly supported phylogenetic trees, these inferences may be artifacts. We suggest that phylogenomic analyses should assess the possible impact of potential biases through comparisons of protein-coding gene data and their amino acid translations by evaluating the impact of substitutional saturation, synonymous substitutions, and compositional biases through data deletion strategies and by analyzing the data using heterogeneous composition models. We caution against relying on any one presentation of the data (nucleotide or amino acid) or any one type of analysis even when analyzing large-scale data sets, no matter how well-supported, without fully exploring the effects of substitution models.', ""Timing Transantarctic Disjunctions In The Atherospermataceae (Laurales): Evidence From Coding And Noncoding Chloroplast Sequences.  [SEP]   Previous studies of the small Southern Hemisphere family Atherospermataceae have drawn contradictory conclusions regarding the number of transantarctic disjunctions and role of transoceanic dispersal in its evolution. Clarification of intergeneric relationships is critical to resolving (1) whether the two Chilean species, Laurelia sempervirens and Laureliopsis philippiana, are related to different Austral-Pacific species, implying two transantarctic disjunctions as suggested by morphology; (2) where the group is likely to have originated; and (3) whether observed disjunctions reflect the breakup of Gondwana. We analyzed chloroplast DNA sequences from six regions (the rbcL gene, the rpl16 intron, and the trnL-trnF, trnT-trnL, psbA-trnH, and atpB-rbcL spacer regions; for all six regions, 4,372 bp) for all genera and most species of Atherospermataceae, using parsimony and maximum likelihood (ML). The family's sister group, the Chilean endemic Gomortega nitida (Gomortegaceae), was used to root the tree. Parsimony and ML yielded identical single best trees that contain three well-supported clades (> or = 75% bootstrap): Daphnandra and Doryphora from south-eastern Australia; Atherosperma and Nemuaron from Australia-Tasmania and New Caledonia, respectively; and Laurelia novac-zelandiac and Laureliopsis philippiana from New Zealand and Chile, respectively. The second Chilean species, Laurelia sempervirens, is sister to this last clade. Likelihood ratio testing did not reject the molecular clock assumption for the rbcL data, which can therefore be used for divergence time estimates. The atherosperm fossil record, which goes back to the Upper Cretaceous, includes pollen, wood, and leaf fossils from Europe, Africa, South America, Antarctica, New Zealand, and Tasmania. Calibration of rbcL substitution rates with the fossils suggests an initial diversification of the family at 100-140 million years ago (MYA), probably in West Gondwana, early entry into Antarctica, and long-distance dispersal to New Zealand and New Caledonia at 50-30 MYA by the ancestors of L. novae-zelandiae and Nemuaron."", 'Resolving An Ancient, Rapid Radiation In Saxifragales.  [SEP]   Despite the prior use of approximately 9000 bp, deep-level relationships within the angiosperm clade, Saxifragales remain enigmatic, due to an ancient, rapid radiation (89.5 to 110 Ma based on the fossil record). To resolve these deep relationships, we constructed several new data sets: (1) 16 genes representing the three genomic compartments within plant cells (2 nuclear, 10 plastid, 4 mitochondrial; aligned, analyzed length = 21,460 bp) for 28 taxa; (2) the entire plastid inverted repeat (IR; 26,625 bp) for 17 taxa; (3) ""total evidence"" (50,845 bp) for both 17 and 28 taxa (the latter missing the IR). Bayesian and ML methods yielded identical topologies across partitions with most clades receiving high posterior probability (pp = 1.0) and bootstrap (95% to 100%) values, suggesting that with sufficient data, rapid radiations can be resolved. In contrast, parsimony analyses of different partitions yielded conflicting topologies, particularly with respect to the placement of Paeoniaceae, a clade characterized by a long branch. In agreement with published simulations, the addition of characters increased bootstrap support for the putatively erroneous placement of Paeoniaceae. Although having far fewer parsimony-informative sites, slowly evolving plastid genes provided higher resolution and support for deep-level relationships than rapidly evolving plastid genes, yielding a topology close to the Bayesian and ML total evidence tree. The plastid IR region may be an ideal source of slowly evolving genes for resolution of deep-level angiosperm divergences that date to 90 My or more. Rapidly evolving genes provided support for tip relationships not recovered with slowly evolving genes, indicating some complementarity. Age estimates using penalized likelihood with and without age constraints for the 28-taxon, total evidence data set are comparable to fossil dates, whereas estimates based on the 17-taxon data are much older than implied by the fossil record. Hence, sufficient taxon density, and not simply numerous base pairs, is important in reliably estimating ages. Age estimates indicate that the early diversification of Saxifragales occurred rapidly, over a time span as short as 6 million years. Between 25,000 and 50,000 bp were needed to resolve this radiation with high support values. Extrapolating from Saxifragales, a similar number of base pairs may be needed to resolve the many other deep-level radiations of comparable age in angiosperms.']"

[SEP]   Contamination of a genetic sample with DNA from one or more nontarget species is a continuing concern of molecular phylogenetic studies, both Sanger sequencing studies and next-generation sequencing studies. We developed an automated pipeline for identifying and excluding likely cross-contaminated loci based on the detection of bimodal distributions of patristic distances across gene trees. When contamination occurs between samples within a data set, a comparison between a contaminated sample and its contaminant taxon will yield bimodal distributions with one peak close to zero patristic distance. This new method does not rely on a priori knowledge of taxon relatedness nor does it determine the causes(s) of the contamination. Exclusion of putatively contaminated loci from a data set generated for the insect family Cicadidae showed that these sequences were affecting some topological patterns and branch supports, although the effects were sometimes subtle, with some contamination-influenced relationships exhibiting strong bootstrap support. Long tip branches and outlier values for one anchored phylogenomic pipeline statistic (AvgNHomologs) were correlated with the presence of contamination. While the anchored hybrid enrichment markers used here, which target hemipteroid taxa, proved effective in resolving deep and shallow level Cicadidae relationships in aggregate, individual markers contained inadequate phylogenetic signal, in part probably due to short length. The cleaned data set, consisting of 429 loci, from 90 genera representing 44 of 56 current Cicadidae tribes, supported three of the four sampled Cicadidae subfamilies in concatenated-matrix maximum likelihood (ML) and multispecies coalescent-based species tree analyses, with the fourth subfamily weakly supported in the ML trees. No well-supported patterns from previous family-level Sanger sequencing studies of Cicadidae phylogeny were contradicted. One taxon (Aragualna plenalinea) did not fall with its current subfamily in the genetic tree, and this genus and its tribe Aragualnini is reclassified to Tibicininae following morphological re-examination. Only subtle differences were observed in trees after the removal of loci for which divergent base frequencies were detected. Greater success may be achieved by increased taxon sampling and developing a probe set targeting a more recent common ancestor and longer loci. Searches for contamination are an essential step in phylogenomic analyses of all kinds and our pipeline is an effective solution.

[SEP]   Restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and target capture of specific genomic regions, such as ultraconserved elements (UCEs), are emerging as two of the most popular methods for phylogenomics using reduced-representation genomic data sets. These two methods were designed to target different evolutionary timescales: RAD-seq was designed for population-genomic level questions and UCEs for deeper phylogenetics. The utility of both data sets to infer phylogenies across a variety of taxonomic levels has not been adequately compared within the same taxonomic system. Additionally, the effects of uninformative gene trees on species tree analyses (for target capture data) have not been explored. Here, we utilize RAD-seq and UCE data to infer a phylogeny of the bird genus Piranga The group has a range of divergence dates (0.5-6 myr), contains 11 recognized species, and lacks a resolved phylogeny. We compared two species tree methods for the RAD-seq data and six species tree methods for the UCE data. Additionally, in the UCE data, we analyzed a complete matrix as well as data sets with only highly informative loci. A complete matrix of 189 UCE loci with 10 or more parsimony informative (PI) sites, and an approximately 80% complete matrix of 1128 PI single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (from RAD-seq) yield the same fully resolved phylogeny of Piranga We inferred non-monophyletic relationships of Piranga lutea individuals, with all other a priori species identified as monophyletic. Finally, we found that species tree analyses that included predominantly uninformative gene trees provided strong support for different topologies, with consistent phylogenetic results when limiting species tree analyses to highly informative loci or only using less informative loci with concatenation or methods meant for SNPs alone.', 'Theoretical And Practical Considerations When Using Retroelement Insertions To Estimate Species Trees In The Anomaly Zone.  [SEP]   A potential shortcoming of concatenation methods for species tree estimation is their failure to account for incomplete lineage sorting. Coalescent methods address this problem but make various assumptions that, if violated, can result in worse performance than concatenation. Given the challenges of analyzing DNA sequences with both concatenation and coalescent methods, retroelement insertions (RIs) have emerged as powerful phylogenomic markers for species tree estimation. Here, we show that two recently proposed quartet-based methods, SDPquartets and ASTRAL_BP, are statistically consistent estimators of the unrooted species tree topology under the coalescent when RIs follow a neutral infinite-sites model of mutation and the expected number of new RIs per generation is constant across the species tree. The accuracy of these (and other) methods for inferring species trees from RIs has yet to be assessed on simulated data sets, where the true species tree topology is known. Therefore, we evaluated eight methods given RIs simulated from four model species trees, all of which have short branches and at least three of which are in the anomaly zone. In our simulation study, ASTRAL_BP and SDPquartets always recovered the correct species tree topology when given a sufficiently large number of RIs, as predicted. A distance-based method (ASTRID_BP) and Dollo parsimony also performed well in recovering the species tree topology. In contrast, unordered, polymorphism, and Camin-Sokal parsimony (as well as an approach based on MDC) typically fail to recover the correct species tree topology in anomaly zone situations with more than four ingroup taxa. Of the methods studied, only ASTRAL_BP automatically estimates internal branch lengths (in coalescent units) and support values (i.e., local posterior probabilities). We examined the accuracy of branch length estimation, finding that estimated lengths were accurate for short branches but upwardly biased otherwise. This led us to derive the maximum likelihood (branch length) estimate for when RIs are given as input instead of binary gene trees; this corrected formula produced accurate estimates of branch lengths in our simulation study provided that a sufficiently large number of RIs were given as input. Lastly, we evaluated the impact of data quantity on species tree estimation by repeating the above experiments with input sizes varying from 100 to 100,000 parsimony-informative RIs. We found that, when given just 1000 parsimony-informative RIs as input, ASTRAL_BP successfully reconstructed major clades (i.e., clades separated by branches $>0.3$ coalescent units) with high support and identified rapid radiations (i.e., shorter connected branches), although not their precise branching order. The local posterior probability was effective for controlling false positive branches in these scenarios.

[SEP]   Landmark-based morphometric methods must estimate the amounts of translation, rotation, and scaling (or, nuisance) parameters to remove nonshape variation from a set of digitized figures. Errors in estimates of these nuisance variables will be reflected in the covariance structure of the coordinates, such as the residuals from a superimposition, or any linear combination of the coordinates, such as the partial warp and standard uniform scores. A simulation experiment was used to compare the ability of the generalized resistant fit (GRF) and a relative warp analysis (RWA) to estimate known covariance matrices with various correlations and variance structures. Random covariance matrices were perturbed so as to vary the magnitude of the average correlation among coordinates, the number of landmarks with excessive variance, and the magnitude of the excessive variance. The covariance structure was applied to random figures with between 6 and 20 landmarks. The results show the expected performance of GRF and RWA across a broad spectrum of conditions. The performance of both GRF and RWA depended most strongly on the number of landmarks. RWA performance decreased slightly when one or a few landmarks had excessive variance. GRF performance peaked when approximately 25% of the landmarks had excessive variance. In general, both RWA and GRF performed better at estimating the direction of the first principal axis of the covariance matrix than the structure of the entire covariance matrix. RWA tended to outperform GRF when > approximately 75% of the coordinates had excessive variance. When < 75% of the coordinates had excessive variance, the relative performance of RWA and GRF depended on the magnitude of the excessive variance; when the landmarks with excessive variance had standard deviations (sigma) > or = 4 sigma minimum, GRF regularly outperformed RWA.', 'Analysis Of Ratios In Multivariate Morphometry.  [SEP]   The analysis of ratios of body measurements is deeply ingrained in the taxonomic literature. Whether for plants or animals, certain ratios are commonly indicated in identification keys, diagnoses, and descriptions. They often provide the only means for separation of cryptic species that mostly lack distinguishing qualitative characters. Additionally, they provide an obvious way to study differences in body proportions, as ratios reflect geometric shape differences. However, when it comes to multivariate analysis of body measurements, for instance, with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) or principal component analysis (PCA), interpretation using body ratios is difficult. Both techniques are commonly applied for separating similar taxa or for exploring the structure of variation, respectively, and require standardized raw or log-transformed variables as input. Here, we develop statistical procedures for the analysis of body ratios in a consistent multivariate statistical framework. In particular, we present algorithms adapted to LDA and PCA that allow the interpretation of numerical results in terms of body proportions. We first introduce a method called the ""LDA ratio extractor,"" which reveals the best ratios for separation of two or more groups with the help of discriminant analysis. We also provide measures for deciding how much of the total differences between individuals or groups of individuals is due to size and how much is due to shape. The second method, a graphical tool called the ""PCA ratio spectrum,"" aims at the interpretation of principal components in terms of body ratios. Based on a similar idea, the ""allometry ratio spectrum"" is developed which can be used for studying the allometric behavior of ratios. Because size can be defined in different ways, we discuss several concepts of size. Central to this discussion is Jolicoeur\'s multivariate generalization of the allometry equation, a concept that was derived only with a heuristic argument. Here we present a statistical derivation of the allometric size vector using the method of least squares. The application of the above methods is extensively demonstrated using published data sets from parasitic wasps and rock crabs.', 'On Information Rank Deficiency In Phenotypic Covariance Matrices.  [SEP]   This article investigates a form of rank deficiency in phenotypic covariance matrices derived from geometric morphometric data, and its impact on measures of phenotypic integration. We first define a type of rank deficiency based on information theory then demonstrate that this deficiency impairs the performance of phenotypic integration metrics in a model system. Lastly, we propose methods to treat for this information rank deficiency. Our first goal is to establish how the rank of a typical geometric morphometric covariance matrix relates to the information entropy of its eigenvalue spectrum. This requires clear definitions of matrix rank, of which we define three: the full matrix rank (equal to the number of input variables), the mathematical rank (the number of nonzero eigenvalues), and the information rank or ""effective rank"" (equal to the number of nonredundant eigenvalues). We demonstrate that effective rank deficiency arises from a combination of methodological factors-Generalized Procrustes analysis, use of the correlation matrix, and insufficient sample size-as well as phenotypic covariance. Secondly, we use dire wolf jaws to document how differences in effective rank deficiency bias two metrics used to measure phenotypic integration. The eigenvalue variance characterizes the integration change incorrectly, and the standardized generalized variance lacks the sensitivity needed to detect subtle changes in integration. Both metrics are impacted by the inclusion of many small, but nonzero, eigenvalues arising from a lack of information in the covariance matrix, a problem that usually becomes more pronounced as the number of landmarks increases. We propose a new metric for phenotypic integration that combines the standardized generalized variance with information entropy. This metric is equivalent to the standardized generalized variance but calculated only from those eigenvalues that carry nonredundant information. It is the standardized generalized variance scaled to the effective rank of the eigenvalue spectrum. We demonstrate that this metric successfully detects the shift of integration in our dire wolf sample. Our third goal is to generalize the new metric to compare data sets with different sample sizes and numbers of variables. We develop a standardization for matrix information based on data permutation then demonstrate that Smilodon jaws are more integrated than dire wolf jaws. Finally, we describe how our information entropy-based measure allows phenotypic integration to be compared in dense semilandmark data sets without bias, allowing characterization of the information content of any given shape, a quantity we term ""latent dispersion"".

[SEP]   Understanding the ecological drivers and limitations of adaptive convergence is a fundamental challenge. Here, we explore how adaptive convergence of planktivorous fishes has been influenced by multiple ecological factors, evolutionary history, and chance. Using ecomorphological data for over 1600 marine species, we integrate pattern-based metrics of convergence with evolutionary model fitting to test whether phenotypic similarities among specialist planktivores exceed expectations under null models and whether ecology, evolutionary history, or their combined effects best explain trait evolution. We find that planktivores are significantly more similar in phenotype than expected. Traits with functional relevance for prey detection and capture, such as eye diameter and lower jaw length, are strongly convergent, while general body size and shape are constrained by deep divisions between clades where the effects of evolutionary history are most pronounced. Since not all traits undergo strong selection toward a convergent ecomorph, their evolutionary trajectories have not entirely overcome ancestral differences in the multivariate trait space, resulting in a specific form of convergence termed conservatism. We show how adaptive responses to feeding ecology intertwine with other ecological pressures (i.e., light environment) and historical contingency to shape fish phenotype evolution over deep time, offering key insights into the generality of phenotypic evolution.', 'Historical Transformation Of Functional Design: Evolutionary Morphology Of Feeding Mechanisms In Loricarioid Catfishes.  [SEP]   The current hypothesis of relationship among the Loricarioidea (a diverse group of Neotropical catfishes) is used as the basis for a case study of historical transformation in the feeding mechanism in this monophyletic clade. The historical approach to functional morphology is discussed and is used in this analysis as a means of examining the evolutionary sequence of structure-function transformation. The distribution of structural novelties in the feeding mechanism and their functional correlates are mapped onto the current hypothesis of loricarioid phylogeny. Three major steps in the transformation of the feeding mechanism are identified. The first was the acquisition of highly mobile premaxillae in the lineage leading to the Callichthyidae, Astroblepidae, and Loricariidae. The second step occurred in the lineage leading to the Astroblepidae and Loricariidae: both families possess highly mobile premaxillae with new muscular insertions and movements that are independent of maxillary mobility. Another specialization at this level was the loss of the interoperculo-mandibular ligament and the acquisition of independent bilateral lower jaw mobility via loss of the tight connection between right and left sides of the lower jaws. The third major step occurred in the lineage leading to the Loricariidae. Further subdivision of the jaw adductor muscle resulted in an additional mesial subdivision with a direct muscle insertion onto the premaxillae. A neomorphic structure, the intermandibular cartilage plug (also shared by astroblepids) is specialized in loricariids with a direct attachment to the hyoid, resulting in an additional biomechanical linkage between the hyoid and mandible. A major trend in the evolution of the loricarioid feeding mechanism is the increase in the number of biomechanical linkages. This is hypothesized to be causally related t o morphological and trophic diversity. Two explicit predictions are made testing the hypothesis that decoupling of primitively constrained biomechanical elements is related to increased morphological and functional diversity in descendant species.', 'The Evolution Of Pharyngognathy: A Phylogenetic And Functional Appraisal Of The Pharyngeal Jaw Key Innovation In Labroid Fishes And Beyond.  [SEP]   The perciform group Labroidei includes approximately 2600 species and comprises some of the most diverse and successful lineages of teleost fishes. Composed of four major clades, Cichlidae, Labridae (wrasses, parrotfishes, and weed whitings), Pomacentridae (damselfishes), and Embiotocidae (surfperches); labroids have been an icon for studies of biodiversity, adaptive radiation, and sexual selection. The success and diversification of labroids have been largely attributed to the presence of a major innovation in the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, pharyngognathy, which is hypothesized to increase feeding capacity and versatility. We present results of large-scale phylogenetic analyses and a survey of pharyngeal jaw functional morphology that allow us to examine the evolution of pharyngognathy in a historical context. Phylogenetic analyses were based on a sample of 188 acanthomorph (spiny-rayed fish) species, primarily percomorphs (perch-like fishes), and DNA sequence data collected from 10 nuclear loci that have been previously used to resolve higher level ray-finned fish relationships. Phylogenies inferred from this dataset using maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and species tree analyses indicate polyphyly of the traditional Labroidei and clearly separate Labridae from the remainder of the traditional labroid lineages (Cichlidae, Embiotocidae, and Pomacentridae). These three ""chromide"" families grouped within a newly discovered clade of 40 families and more than 4800 species (>27% of percomorphs and >16% of all ray-finned fishes), which we name Ovalentaria for its characteristic demersal, adhesive eggs with chorionic filaments. This fantastically diverse clade includes some of the most species-rich lineages of marine and freshwater fishes, including all representatives of the Cichlidae, Embiotocidae, Pomacentridae, Ambassidae, Gobiesocidae, Grammatidae, Mugilidae, Opistognathidae, Pholidichthyidae, Plesiopidae (including Notograptus), Polycentridae, Pseudochromidae, Atherinomorpha, and Blennioidei. Beyond the discovery of Ovalentaria, this study provides a surprising, but well-supported, hypothesis for a convict-blenny (Pholidichthys) sister group to the charismatic cichlids and new insights into the evolution of pharyngognathy. Bayesian stochastic mapping ancestral state reconstructions indicate that pharyngognathy has evolved at least six times in percomorphs, including four separate origins in members of the former Labroidei, one origin in the Centrogenyidae, and one origin within Beloniformes. Our analyses indicate that all pharyngognathous fishes have a mechanically efficient biting mechanism enabled by the muscular sling and a single lower jaw element. However, a major distinction exists between Labridae, which lacks the widespread, generalized percomorph pharyngeal biting mechanism, and all other pharyngognathous clades, which possess this generalized biting mechanism in addition to pharyngognathy. Our results reveal a remarkable history of pharyngognathy: far from a single origin, it appears to have evolved at least six times, and its status as a major evolutionary innovation is reinforced by it being a synapomorphy for several independent major radiations, including some of the most species rich and ecologically diverse percomorph clades of coral reef and tropical freshwater fishes, Labridae and Cichlidae.

[SEP]   Three concepts of ancestry are distinguished, the individual organism as ancestor, the population or species as ancestor, and the supraspecific taxon as ancestor. Of these, only the first two can be objectively applied, the third is a taxonomic artifact. Of the first two, only the population or species as ancestor is used extensively in phylogeny reconstruction. We adopt the view that empirical or objective statements must be potentially falsifiable. The introduction of initial assumptions concerning the historical interpretation of empirical relationships can make phylogeny objective in this sense. We suggest that our outlook precludes identification of ancestors as self-evident. But, does it preclude hypotheses of ancestry? The strongest case for incorporating hypotheses of populational or species ancestors into phylogenetic reconstructions rests on the conclusion that the incorporation of such hypotheses seems to add to the information content of a purely ""cladistic"" statement. On morphological grounds, a statement of ancestor-descendant relationships would seem falsifiable if the hypothesis can be refuted by finding autapomorphies and can be corroborated by finding plesiomorphies in the supposed ancestor. We explore the nature of phylogenetic testing to assess this conjecture. In testing the relationships of a limited group of organisms, conflicts between alternate phylogenetic hypotheses may be resolved without introducing bias if those sets of characters which provide valid tests (the apomorphies) can be sorted out from those sets of characters which do not (the non-homologies and plesiomorphies). The weighting of characters as apomorphous, plesiomorphous, or non-homologous is an appeal to parsimony which represents an effort to sort out which set of characters provide tests of relationship within the problem at hand, given a higher level phylogeny. The resultant estimate will be the most parsimonious of the alternatives within the context of the higher level phylogeny. This estimate may or may not prove most parsimonious in an unweighted character analysis of the problem at hand carried out in isolation from the higher level phylogeny. It is the adoption of the higher level phylogeny which allows the investigator to objectively assess a problem of realistic proportions without ignoring relevant information. Plesiomorphies can not be used to test phylogenetic hypotheses because they are ad hoc statements required by the acceptance of the most parsimonious solution. Therefore, they can not provide corroboration for ancestor-descendant relationships. Autapomorphies are identified because they supposedly differ from the hypothetical ancestor. But, the ancestral morphotype is not a scientific statement, rather, it is a simple summary of characters derived from a cladistic hypothesis. An autapomorphy can only be identified by rejecting the alternate character as synapomorphous. We conclude that autapomorphies can not refute ancestor-descendant relationships. Therefore, given our initial assumptions, ancestor-descendant relationships based on morphology are not objective statements when applied to fossil populations or species. With the additional assumption that a particular cladistic relationship is true, ancestor-descendant relationships might be testable, but, this would render the cladistic relationships untestable. Another argument states that when fossil samples are close in time and space, it is more parsimonious to postulate that the ancestor is represented in the lower stratigraphic sample than to postulate it is missing. The apparent success of this argument rests on the requirement that the investigator answer a question that can not be answered objectively because its structure limits the alternate answers to non-objective statements.', 'The Ontogenetic Method For Determining Character Polarity And Its Relevance To Phylogenetic Systematics.  [SEP]   In an attempt to clarify the relevance of ontogenetic transformations for systematics, the ontogenetic method for determining character polarity (the biogenetic law of Nelson, 1978) is analyzed from the perspective of phylogenetic systematics. In phylogenetic systematics, as defined here, the relationships sought are those of common ancestry and, thus, the concept of phylogeny is taken as an axiom from which systematic methods are deduced. This perspective has a number of consequences concerning the role of ontogenetic transformations in systematics, among which are the following: (1) Von Baer\'s second law, which states that less general characters are developed from the most general, is not universally true. (2) The validity of Nelson\'s biogenetic law (not to be confused with other concepts of similar name) does not depend on the validity of von Baer\'s law. (3) As a theory about the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny, Nelson\'s biogenetic law can only be tested by known character phylogenies. However, outgroup, paleontological, and ontogenetic methods of polarity determination need not be interpreted as scientific theories; instead, they can be interpreted as theorems deduced from the axiom of phylogeny and certain auxiliary assumptions. (4) The usefulness of the ontogenetic method rests on an assumption of ancestral character retention. If ancestral characters are retained in descendant ontogenies, then ancestral characters will be more general than their phylogenetic derivatives. (5) The sequence of ontogenetic transformation is irrelevant to the usefulness of the ontogenetic method; generality is the critical factor. (6) An ""ontogenetic"" method based on generality may be useful for determining evolutionary polarity when characters are instantaneous morphologies, but ontogenetic transformations rather than instantaneous morphologies are more appropriately considered characters when attempting to determine phylogenetic relationships among organisms. When ontogenetic transformations are viewed as characters, there can be no ontogenetic method for determining evolutionary character polarity; however, the comparative phylogenetic method properly involves a comparison of ontogenetic transformations. (7) Ontogenetic polarities are different than phylogenetic polarities; the two have the relationship of part to whole, respectively. (8) For characters that exhibit ontogenetic transformation, homology is distinct from synapomorphy. (9) Finally, there is no threefold parallelism in phylogenetic systematics. Comparative anatomy, paleontology, and embryology are not three separate disciplines within systematics; rather, the three form a single comparative method unified in the organism by the concept of evolution.', 'Problems With The Interpretation Of Developmental Sequences.  [SEP]   Some systematists, pattern cladists in particular, have recently argued that phylogenetic patterns are essentially a reflection of the ""orderliness of ontogeny."" In fact, these authors contend that information derived from the study of ontogenetic sequences is the most reliable source to determine character polarities. Heterochronic analysis, in spite of its emphasis on process over pattern, shares many of the same assumptions about ontogeny. This is because both systematic and heterochronic analyses belong to the comparative tradition of embryology. Essentially, ontogeny is viewed as a sequence of morphological stages that are assumed to be conserved. Furthermore, in spite of claims that the analyses are based on Von Baer\'s law, the approach is fundamentally Haeckelian, since its comparison of ontogenies (at least in the manner currently done in systematics and heterochrony) requires that embryonic stages be homologized with adult stages. Nelson\'s revised ""biogenetic law"" is used as an example to illustrate these points. The nature and informational value of ontogenetic sequences are examined and I conclude that, in contrast with strictly temporal sequences, the only ""meaningful"" sequences (in the sense that they will be conserved through phylogeny) are the causal ones, where the antecedent stage is required for the expression of the subsequent one. However, I present some examples of causal sequences where inductive relationships change through phylogeny. Therefore, there are no good arguments to assume a priori that ontogenetic sequences are conserved. A more fundamental problem is pointed out when I discuss that the methodology of comparison of ontogenetic sequences, used by systematists and heterochronists, is not compatible with the dynamic perspective of development endorsed by experimental and mechanistically-oriented embryologists. Examples are provided where, although the process can be arranged in a sequence of stages, these are effectively meaningless and useless in a systematic context. Two additional empirical cases are discussed where a heterochronic analysis is integrated within a dynamical framework of development. A paradox emerges, since the resultant morphology in the derived species is not represented in the primitive (""ancestral"") ontogenetic sequence, in spite of the fact that it has been produced by a regulation in the timing and developmental rates of the ancestral ontogeny. I conclude that these problems result from the usage of a static and unrealistic view of ontogeny. A major challenge in systematics will be to incorporate the dynamic perspective of development into a methodological framework amenable to comparative analysis. I agree with Nelson and others in that development is ordered and that this internal order structures pattern. However, the information is not necessarily in the ontogenetic sequence.']"

[SEP]   A quantitative solution for Hennig\'s parasitological method is presented. Cladograms summarizing natural relationships among parasite taxa are converted into host-group characters by means of additive binary coding. Unrooted Wagner analysis followed by most parsimonious rooting produces a maximum information-content representation of natural host-parasite relationships. Because host-parasite relationships result either from random colonization or from co-speciation, host relationships well corroborated by a multi-parasite analysis correspond to host phylogeny. Poorly corroborated host relationships indicate an ambiguous parasite message alerting a worker to possible host transfers. Thus, such analyses point out co-speciation and random colonization components of host-parasite systems. Single or multiple parasite taxa may be used. A host phylogeny based on non-parasite characters is neither necessary nor sufficient for studying phylogenetic aspects of coevolution, although such may be helpful in testing ambiguous aspects. Once a host-group cladogram based on parasites has been established, phylogenetic interpretations for each observed host-parasite relationship may be made according to a listed set of necessary and sufficient criteria. Finally, evaluation of two models of coevolution, a ""vicariance"" model and the ""resource-tracking"" model, indicates that the latter cannot be extrapolated successfully to explain congruent phylogenetic differentiation of hosts and parasites and that the former model represents the general pattern of natural relationships among hosts and parasites.', 'Effect Of Host-Switching On The Ecological And Evolutionary Patterns Of Parasites.  [SEP]   Speciation via host-switching is a macroevolutionary process that emerges from a microevolutionary dynamic where individual parasites switch hosts, establish a new association, and reduce reproductive contact with the original parasite lineage. Phylogenetic distance and geographic distribution of the hosts have been shown to be determinants of the capacity and opportunity of the parasite to change hosts. Although speciation via host-switching has been reported in many host-parasite systems, its dynamic on the individual, population and community levels is poorly understood. Here we propose a theoretical model to simulate parasite evolution considering host-switching events on the microevolutionary scale, taking into account the macroevolutionary history of the hosts, to evaluate how host-switching can affect ecological and evolutionary patterns of parasites in empirical communities at regional and local scales. In the model, parasite individuals can switch hosts under variable intensity and have their evolution driven by mutation and genetic drift. Mating is sexual and only individuals that are sufficiently similar can produce offspring. We assumed that parasite evolution occurs at the same evolutionary time scale as their hosts, and that the intensity of host-switching decreases as the host species differentiate. Ecological and evolutionary patterns were characterized by the turnover of parasite species among host species, and parasite evolutionary tree imbalance respectively. We found a range of host-switching intensity that reproduces ecological and evolutionary patterns observed in empirical communities. Our results showed that turnover decreased as host-switching intensity increased, with low variation among the model replications. On the other hand, tree imbalance showed wide variation and non-monotonic tendency. We concluded that tree imbalance was sensitive to stochastic events, whereas turnover may be a good indicator of host-switching. We found that local communities corresponded to higher host-switching intensity when compared to regional communities, highlighting that spatial scale is a limitation for host-switching.

[SEP]   Cospeciation generally increases the similarity between host and parasite phylogenies. Incongruence between host and parasite phylogenies has previously been explained in terms of host switching, sorting, and duplication events. Here, we describe an additional process, failure of the parasite to speciate in response to host speciation, that may be important in some host-parasite systems. Failure to speciate is likely to occur when gene flow among parasite populations is much higher than that of their hosts. We reconstructed trees from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences for pigeons and doves (Aves: Columbiformes) and their feather lice in the genus Columbicola (Insecta: Phthiraptera). Although comparisons of the trees from each group revealed a significant amount of cospeciation, there was also a significant degree of incongruence. Cophylogenetic analyses generally indicated that host switching may be an important process in the history of this host-parasite association. Using terminal sister taxon comparisons, we also identified three apparent cases where the host has speciated but the associated parasite has not. In two of these cases of failure to speciate, these comparisons involve allopatric sister taxa of hosts whose lice also occur on hosts sympatric with both of the allopatric sisters. These additional hosts for generalist lice may promote gene flow with lice on the allopatric sister species. Relative rate comparisons for the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene indicate that molecular substitution occurs about 11 times faster in lice than in their avian hosts.']"

[SEP]   It is a classic aim of quantitative and evolutionary biology to infer genetic architecture and potential evolutionary responses to selection from the variance-covariance structure of measured traits. But a meaningful genetic or developmental interpretation of raw covariances is difficult, and classic concepts of morphological integration do not directly apply to modern morphometric data. Here, we present a new morphometric strategy based on the comparison of morphological variation across different spatial scales. If anatomical elements vary completely independently, then their variance accumulates at larger scales or for structures composed of multiple elements: morphological variance would be a power function of spatial scale. Deviations from this pattern of ""variational self-similarity"" (serving as a null model of completely uncoordinated growth) indicate genetic or developmental coregulation of anatomical components. We present biometric strategies and R scripts for identifying patterns of coordination and compensation in the size and shape of composite anatomical structures. In an application to human cranial variation, we found that coordinated variation and positive correlations are prevalent for the size of cranial components, whereas their shape was dominated by compensatory variation, leading to strong canalization of cranial shape at larger scales. We propose that mechanically induced bone formation and remodeling are key mechanisms underlying compensatory variation in cranial shape. Such epigenetic coordination and compensation of growth are indispensable for stable, canalized development and may also foster the evolvability of complex anatomical structures by preserving spatial and functional integrity during genetic responses to selection.[Cranial shape; developmental canalization; evolvability; morphological integration; morphometrics; phenotypic variation; self-similarity.].', 'Geometric Morphometrics On Gene Expression Patterns Within Phenotypes: A Case Example On Limb Development.  [SEP]   How the genotype translates into the phenotype through development is critical to fully understand the evolution of phenotypes. We propose a novel approach to directly assess how changes in gene expression patterns are associated with changes in morphology using the limb as a case example. Our method combines molecular biology techniques, such as whole-mount in situ hybridization, with image and shape analysis, extending the use of Geometric Morphometrics to the analysis of nonanatomical shapes, such as gene expression domains. Elliptical Fourier and Procrustes-based semilandmark analyses were used to analyze the variation and covariation patterns of the limb bud shape with the expression patterns of two relevant genes for limb morphogenesis, Hoxa11 and Hoxa13. We devised a multiple thresholding method to semiautomatically segment gene domains at several expression levels in large samples of limb buds from C57Bl6 mouse embryos between 10 and 12 postfertilization days. Besides providing an accurate phenotyping tool to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene expression patterns within developing structures, our morphometric analyses revealed high, non-random, and gene-specific variation undergoing canalization during limb development. Our results demonstrate that Hoxa11 and Hoxa13, despite being paralogs with analogous functions in limb patterning, show clearly distinct dynamic patterns, both in shape and size, and are associated differently with the limb bud shape. The correspondence between our results and already well-established molecular processes underlying limb development confirms that this morphometric approach is a powerful tool to extract features of development regulating morphogenesis. Such multilevel analyses are promising in systems where not so much molecular information is available and will advance our understanding of the genotype-phenotype map. In systematics, this knowledge will increase our ability to infer how evolution modified a common developmental pattern to generate a wide diversity of morphologies, as in the vertebrate limb.', 'Finite-Element Scaling Applied To Sexual Dimorphism In Rhesus Macaque (Macaca Mulatta) Facial Growth.  [SEP]   While many advances have been made in the statistical treatment of morphometrics, there has been little improvement in the design of measurements subjected to statistical analysis. Commonly measured linear dimensions result in a loss of geometrical integrity and an inability to translate multivariate statistical results into material three-dimensional morphology. Problems with the definition of size and shape, spurious correlation, and anatomical localization of form change or difference arise with linear dimensions. Finite-element scaling methods overcome these problems and produce measures that can be subjected to standard multivariate statistical analyses. The finite-element scaling method is described, as are measures of local and general size and shape change. We use finite-element scaling as a basis for an analysis of sexual dimorphism in rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) facial growth. Males grow approximately twice as fast as females, although facial growth stops at nearly the same age in the two sexes. The adult female face is morphologically quite similar in all aspects of size and shape to that of a juvenile male (4.5 years old). Thus, considered heterochronically, and taking the female morphology as primitive, sexual dimorphism in the size and shape of the rhesus face arose through rate hypermorphosis. Growth of the face was strongly allometric, with the maxillary alveolus growing much faster than other facial regions. Finite-element scaling is a very useful measurement tool for the comparison of forms, especially in studies of growth and phylogenetic transformation.']"

[SEP]   Adaptive convergence in morphological characters has not been thoroughly investigated, and the processes by which phylogenetic relationships may be misled by morphological convergence remains unclear. We undertook a case study on the morphological evolution of viverrid-like feliformians (Nandinia, Cryptoprocta, Fossa, Eupleres, Prionodon) and built the largest morphological matrix concerning the suborder Feliformia to date. A total of 349 characters grouped into four anatomical partitions were used for all species of Viverridae and viverrid-like taxa plus representatives of the Felidae, Hyaenidae, Herpestidae, and one Malagasy mongoose. Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that viverrid-like morphotypes appeared independently at least three times during feliformian evolution. We thus used a synthetic molecular tree to assess morphological evolutionary patterns characterizing the viverrid-like taxa. We examined phylogenetic signal, convergence and noise in morphological characters using (a) tree-length distribution (g1), (b) partitioned Bremer support, (c) RI values and their distribution, (d) respective contributions of diagnostic synapomorphies at the nodes for each partition, (e) patterns of shared convergences among viverrid-like taxa and other feliformian lineages, (f) tree-length differences among alternative hypotheses, and (g) the successive removal of convergent character states from the original matrix. In addition, the lability of complex morphological structures was assessed by mapping them onto the synthetic molecular tree. The unconstrained morphological analysis yielded phylogenetic groupings that closely reflected traditional classification. The use of a synthetic molecular tree (constraint) combined with our thorough morphological investigations revealed the mosaics of convergences likely to have contributed to part of the historical uncertainty over viverrid classification. It also showed that complex morphological structures could be subjected to reversible evolutionary trends. The morphological matrix proved useful in characterizing several feliformian clades with diagnostic synapomorphies. These results support the removal from the traditionally held Viverridae of several viverrid-like taxa into three distinct families: Nandiniidae (Nandinia), Prionodontidae (Prionodon), and the newly defined Eupleridae (including Cryptoprocta, Fossa, Eupleres plus all ""mongoose-like"" Malagasy taxa). No clearly ""phylogenetically misleading"" data subsets could be identified, and the great majority of morphological convergences appeared to be nonadaptive. The multiple approaches used in this study revealed that the most disruptive element with regards to morphological phylogenetic reconstruction was noise, which blured the expression of phylogenetic signal. This study demonstrates the crucial need to consider independent (molecular) phylogenies in order to produce reliable evolutionary hypotheses and should promote a new approach to the definition of morphological characters in mammals.

[SEP]   The calopterygoid superfamily (Calopterygidae + Hetaerinidae) is composed of more than twenty genera in two families: the Calopterygidae (at least 17) and the Hetaerinidae (at least 4). Here, 62 calopterygoid (ingroup) taxa representing 18 genera and 15 outgroup taxa are subjected to phylogenetic analysis using the ribosomal 18S and 5.8S genes and internal transcribed spacers (ITS1, ITS2). The five other families of calopterid affinity (Polythoridae, Dicteriadidae, Amphipterygidae, Euphaeidae, and Chlorocyphidae) are included in the outgroup. For phylogenetic inference, we applied maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and the Bayesian inference methods. A molecular phylogeny combined with a geographic analysis produced a well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis that partly confirms the traditional taxonomy and describes distributional patterns. A monophyletic origin of the calopterygoids emerges, revealing the Hetaerinid clade as sister group to the Calopterygidae sensu strictu. Within Calopterygidae, seven clades of subfamily rank are recognized. Phylogenetic dating was performed with semiparametric rate smoothing by penalized likelihood, using seven reference fossils for calibration. Divergence time based on the ribosomal genes and spacers and fossil constraints indicate that Calopteryginae (10 genera, approximately 50% of all Calopterygid taxa studied here), Vestalinae (1 genus), and Hetaerinidae (1 genus out of 4 studied here) started radiating around 65 Mya (K/T boundary). The South American Iridictyon (without distinctive morphology except for wing venation) and Southeast Asian Noguchiphaea (with distinctive morphology) are older (about 86 My) and may be survivors of old clades with a Gondwanian range that went extinct at the K/T boundary. The same reasoning (and an even older age, ca. 150 My) applies to the amphipterygids Rimanella and Pentaphlebia (South America-Africa). The extant Calopterygidae show particular species and genus richness between west China and Japan, with genera originating between the early Oligocene and Pleistocene. Much of that richness probably extended much wider in preglacial times. The Holarctic Calopteryx, of Miocene age, was deeply affected by the climatic cooling of the Pliocene and by the Pleistocene glaciations. Its North American and Japanese representatives are of Miocene and Pliocene age, respectively, but its impoverished Euro-Siberian taxa are late Pliocene-Pleistocene, showing reinvasion, speciation, and introgression events.

[SEP]   The lack of a readily accessible roster of nuclear genes informative at various taxonomic levels is a bottleneck for molecular systematics. In this report, we describe the first phylogenetic application of the sequence that encodes the enzyme dopa decarboxylase (DDC). For 14 test species within the noctuid moth subfamily Heliothinae that represent the previously best-supported groupings, a 690-bp fragment of DDC resolved relationships that are largely concordant with prior evidence from elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha), morphology, and allozymes. Although both synonymous and nonsynonymous changes occur in DDC substantially more rapidly than they do in EF-1 alpha, DDC divergences within Heliothinae are below saturation at all codon positions. Analysis of DDC and EF-1 alpha in combination resulted in increased bootstrap support for several groupings. As a first estimate of previously unresolved relationships, DDC sequences were analyzed from 16 additional heliothines, for a total of 30 heliothine species plus outgroups. Previous relationships based on DDC were generally stable with increased taxon sampling, although a two- to eightfold downweighting of codon position 3 was required for complete concordance with the 14-species result. The weighted strict consensus trees were largely resolved and were congruent with most although not all previous hypotheses based on either morphology or EF-1 alpha. The proposed phylogeny suggests that the major agricultural pest heliothines belong to a single clade, characterized by polyphagy and associated life history traits, within this largely host-specific moth subfamily. DDC holds much promise for phylogenetic analysis of Tertiary-age animal groups.']"

[SEP]   Consensus methods provide a useful strategy for summarizing information from a collection of gene trees. An important application of consensus methods is to combine gene trees to estimate a species tree. To investigate the theoretical properties of consensus trees that would be obtained from large numbers of loci evolving according to a basic evolutionary model, we construct consensus trees from rooted gene trees that occur in proportion to gene-tree probabilities derived from coalescent theory. We consider majority-rule, rooted triple (R(*)), and greedy consensus trees obtained from known, rooted gene trees, both in the asymptotic case as numbers of gene trees approach infinity and for finite numbers of genes. Our results show that for some combinations of species-tree branch lengths, increasing the number of independent loci can make the rooted majority-rule consensus tree more likely to be at least partially unresolved. However, the probability that the R(*) consensus tree has the species-tree topology approaches 1 as the number of gene trees approaches infinity. Although the greedy consensus algorithm can be the quickest to converge on the correct species-tree topology when increasing the number of gene trees, it can also be positively misleading. The majority-rule consensus tree is not a misleading estimator of the species-tree topology, and the R(*) consensus tree is a statistically consistent estimator of the species-tree topology. Our results therefore suggest a method for using multiple loci to infer the species-tree topology, even when it is discordant with the most likely gene tree.', ""The Metric Properties Of Dna-Dna Hybridization Dissimilarity Measures.  [SEP]   Under a simple model of DNA sequence dissociation, DNA-DNA hybridization dissimilarity measures are expected to behave like the complement of Gower's coefficient of similarity, calculated for each pair of taxonomic units (i, k) across i homologues (nucleotide positions) with four possible states, multiplied by a constant relating base-pair mismatch to the temperature of DNA dissociation. DNA dissimilarity measures that include information only from homologues, therefore, are expected to conform to the axioms of a metric. Empirically, we have found that measures of dissimilarity between single-copy nuclear genomes regularly conform to 3 of the 4 metric axioms: identity, distinctness, and the triangle inequality. However, reciprocal values frequently fail to conform to the fourth axiom, symmetry. For some measures dependent upon the percent of reassociation (e.g., delta T50H), failure of symmetry can occur when sequences present in one genome have no homologue in other genomes (e.g., as a result of sequence deletion or lateral transfer). For all measures, including delta mode and delta Tm, the presence of sequences in one genome that lack a homologue in other genomes differentially affects the effective concentration of shared sequences in reciprocal reactions, causing reciprocal measurements to represent comparisons of different sets of sequences. This effect also potentially obtains under certain conditions of sequence duplication and divergence.

[SEP]   The homobasidiomycetes is a diverse group of macrofungi that includes mushrooms, puffballs, coral fungi, and other forms. This study used maximum likelihood methods to determine if there are general trends (evolutionary tendencies) in the evolution of fruiting body forms in homobasidiomycetes, and to estimate the ancestral forms of the homobasidiomycetes and euagarics clade. Character evolution was modeled using a published 481-species phylogeny under two character-coding regimes: additive binary coding, using DISCRETE, and multistate (five-state) coding, using MULTISTATE. Inferences regarding trends in character evolution made under binary coding were often in conflict with those made under multistate coding, suggesting that the additive binary coding approach cannot serve as a surrogate for multistate methods. MULTISTATE was used to develop a""minimal""model of fruiting body evolution, in which the 20 parameters that specify rates of transformations among character states were grouped into the fewest possible rate categories. The minimal model required only four rate categories, one of which is approaching zero, and suggests the following conclusions regarding trends in evolution of homobasidiomycete fruiting bodies: (1) there is an active trend favoring the evolution of pileate-stipitate forms (those with a cap and stalk); (2) the hypothesis that the evolution of gasteroid forms (those with internal spore production, such as puffballs) is irreversible cannot be rejected; and (3) crustlike resupinate forms are not a particularly labile morphology. The latter finding contradicts the conclusions of a previous study that used binary character coding. Ancestral state reconstructions under binary coding suggest that the ancestor of the homobasidiomycetes was resupinate and the ancestor of the euagarics clade was pileate-stipitate, but ancestral state reconstructions under multistate coding did not resolve the ancestral form of either node. The results of this study illustrate the potential sensitivity of comparative analyses to character state definitions.', 'A Phylogenetic Estimation Of Trophic Transition Networks For Ascomycetous Fungi: Are Lichens Cradles Of Symbiotrophic Fungal Diversification?.  [SEP]   Fungi associated with photosynthetic organisms are major determinants of terrestrial biomass, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem productivity from the poles to the equator. Whereas most fungi are known because of their fruit bodies (e.g., saprotrophs), symptoms (e.g., pathogens), or emergent properties as symbionts (e.g., lichens), the majority of fungal diversity is thought to occur among species that rarely manifest their presence with visual cues on their substrate (e.g., the apparently hyperdiverse fungal endophytes associated with foliage of plants). Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous among all lineages of land plants and live within overtly healthy tissues without causing disease, but the evolutionary origins of these highly diverse symbionts have not been explored. Here, we show that a key to understanding both the evolution of endophytism and the diversification of the most species-rich phylum of Fungi (Ascomycota) lies in endophyte-like fungi that can be isolated from the interior of apparently healthy lichens. These ""endolichenic"" fungi are distinct from lichen mycobionts or any other previously recognized fungal associates of lichens, represent the same major lineages of Ascomycota as do endophytes, largely parallel the high diversity of endophytes from the arctic to the tropics, and preferentially associate with green algal photobionts in lichen thalli. Using phylogenetic analyses that incorporate these newly recovered fungi and ancestral state reconstructions that take into account phylogenetic uncertainty, we show that endolichenism is an incubator for the evolution of endophytism. In turn, endophytism is evolutionarily transient, with endophytic lineages frequently transitioning to and from pathogenicity. Although symbiotrophic lineages frequently give rise to free-living saprotrophs, reversions to symbiosis are rare. Together, these results provide the basis for estimating trophic transition networks in the Ascomycota and provide a first set of hypotheses regarding the evolution of symbiotrophy and saprotrophy in the most species-rich fungal phylum.

[SEP]   Ancestral state reconstructions of morphological or ecological traits on molecular phylogenies are becoming increasingly frequent. They rely on constancy of character state change rates over trees, a correlation between neutral genetic change and phenotypic change, as well as on adequate likelihood models and (for Bayesian methods) prior distributions. This investigation explored the outcomes of a variety of methods for reconstructing discrete ancestral state in the ascus apex of the Lecanorales, a group containing the majority of lichen-forming ascomycetes. Evolution of this character complex has been highly controversial in lichen systematics for more than two decades. The phylogeny was estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo inference on DNA sequence alignments of three genes (small subunit of the mitochondrial rDNA, large subunit of the nuclear rDNA, and largest subunit of RNA polymerase II). We designed a novel method for assessing the suitable number of discrete gamma categories, which relies on the effect on phylogeny estimates rather than on likelihoods. Ancestral state reconstructions were performed using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood on a posterior tree sample as well as two fully Bayesian methods. Resulting reconstructions were often strikingly different depending on the method used; different methods often assign high confidence to different states at a given node. The two fully Bayesian methods disagree about the most probable reconstruction in about half of the nodes, even when similar likelihood models and similar priors are used. We suggest that similar studies should use several methods, awaiting an improved understanding of the statistical properties of the methods. A Lecanora-type ascus may have been ancestral in the Lecanorales. State transformations counts, obtained using stochastic mapping, indicate that the number of state changes is 12 to 24, which is considerably greater than the minimum three changes needed to explain the four observed ascus apex types. Apparently, the ascus in the Lecanorales is far more apt to change than has been recognized. Phylogeny corresponds well with morphology, although it partly contradicts currently used delimitations of the Crocyniaceae, Haematommataceae, Lecanoraceae, Megalariaceae, Mycoblastaceae, Pilocarpaceae, Psoraceae, Ramalinaceae, Scoliciosporaceae, and Squamarinaceae.']"

[SEP]   Sequencing of target-enriched libraries is an efficient and cost-effective method for obtaining DNA sequence data from hundreds of nuclear loci for phylogeny reconstruction. Much of the cost of developing targeted sequencing approaches is associated with the generation of preliminary data needed for the identification of orthologous loci for probe design. In plants, identifying orthologous loci has proven difficult due to a large number of whole-genome duplication events, especially in the angiosperms (flowering plants). We used multiple sequence alignments from over 600 angiosperms for 353 putatively single-copy protein-coding genes identified by the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative to design a set of targeted sequencing probes for phylogenetic studies of any angiosperm group. To maximize the phylogenetic potential of the probes, while minimizing the cost of production, we introduce a k-medoids clustering approach to identify the minimum number of sequences necessary to represent each coding sequence in the final probe set. Using this method, 5-15 representative sequences were selected per orthologous locus, representing the sequence diversity of angiosperms more efficiently than if probes were designed using available sequenced genomes alone. To test our approximately 80,000 probes, we hybridized libraries from 42 species spanning all higher-order groups of angiosperms, with a focus on taxa not present in the sequence alignments used to design the probes. Out of a possible 353 coding sequences, we recovered an average of 283 per species and at least 100 in all species. Differences among taxa in sequence recovery could not be explained by relatedness to the representative taxa selected for probe design, suggesting that there is no phylogenetic bias in the probe set. Our probe set, which targeted 260 kbp of coding sequence, achieved a median recovery of 137 kbp per taxon in coding regions, a maximum recovery of 250 kbp, and an additional median of 212 kbp per taxon in flanking non-coding regions across all species. These results suggest that the Angiosperms353 probe set described here is effective for any group of flowering plants and would be useful for phylogenetic studies from the species level to higher-order groups, including the entire angiosperm clade itself.', 'Unfate: A Comprehensive Probe Set And Bioinformatics Pipeline For Phylogeny Reconstruction And Multilocus Barcoding Of Filamentous Ascomycetes (Ascomycota, Pezizomycotina).  [SEP]   The subphylum Pezizomycotina (filamentous ascomycetes) is the largest clade within Ascomycota. Despite the importance of this group of fungi, our understanding of their evolution is still limited due to insufficient taxon sampling. Although next-generation sequencing technology allows us to obtain complete genomes for phylogenetic analyses, generating complete genomes of fungal species can be challenging, especially when fungi occur in symbiotic relationships or when the DNA of rare herbarium specimens is degraded or contaminated. Additionally, assembly, annotation, and gene extraction of whole-genome sequencing data require bioinformatics skills and computational power, resulting in a substantial data burden. To overcome these obstacles, we designed a universal target enrichment probe set to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of filamentous ascomycetes at different phylogenetic levels. From a pool of single-copy orthologous genes extracted from available Pezizomycotina genomes, we identified the smallest subset of genetic markers that can reliably reconstruct a robust phylogeny. We used a clustering approach to identify a sequence set that could provide an optimal trade-off between potential missing data and probe set cost. We incorporated this probe set into a user-friendly wrapper script named UnFATE (https://github.com/claudioametrano/UnFATE) that allows phylogenomic inferences without requiring expert bioinformatics knowledge. In addition to phylogenetic results, the software provides a powerful multilocus alternative to ITS-based barcoding. Phylogeny and barcoding approaches can be complemented by an integrated, pre-processed, and periodically updated database of all publicly available Pezizomycotina genomes. The UnFATE pipeline, using the 195 selected marker genes, consistently performed well across various phylogenetic depths, generating trees consistent with the reference phylogenomic inferences. The topological distance between the reference trees from literature and the best tree produced by UnFATE ranged between 0.10 and 0.14 (nRF) for phylogenies from family to subphylum level. We also tested the in vitro success of the universal baits set in a target capture approach on 25 herbarium specimens from ten representative classes in Pezizomycotina, which recovered a topology congruent with recent phylogenomic inferences for this group of fungi. The discriminating power of our gene set was also assessed by the multilocus barcoding approach, which outperformed the barcoding approach based on ITS. With these tools, we aim to provide a framework for a collaborative approach to build robust, conclusive phylogenies of this important fungal clade.', 'A Comprehensive Phylogenomic Platform For Exploring The Angiosperm Tree Of Life.  [SEP]   The tree of life is the fundamental biological roadmap for navigating the evolution and properties of life on Earth, and yet remains largely unknown. Even angiosperms (flowering plants) are fraught with data gaps, despite their critical role in sustaining terrestrial life. Today, high-throughput sequencing promises to significantly deepen our understanding of evolutionary relationships. Here, we describe a comprehensive phylogenomic platform for exploring the angiosperm tree of life, comprising a set of open tools and data based on the 353 nuclear genes targeted by the universal Angiosperms353 sequence capture probes. The primary goals of this article are to (i) document our methods, (ii) describe our first data release, and (iii) present a novel open data portal, the Kew Tree of Life Explorer (https://treeoflife.kew.org). We aim to generate novel target sequence capture data for all genera of flowering plants, exploiting natural history collections such as herbarium specimens, and augment it with mined public data. Our first data release, described here, is the most extensive nuclear phylogenomic data set for angiosperms to date, comprising 3099 samples validated by DNA barcode and phylogenetic tests, representing all 64 orders, 404 families (96$\\%$) and 2333 genera (17$\\%$). A ""first pass"" angiosperm tree of life was inferred from the data, which totaled 824,878 sequences, 489,086,049 base pairs, and 532,260 alignment columns, for interactive presentation in the Kew Tree of Life Explorer. This species tree was generated using methods that were rigorous, yet tractable at our scale of operation. Despite limitations pertaining to taxon and gene sampling, gene recovery, models of sequence evolution and paralogy, the tree strongly supports existing taxonomy, while challenging numerous hypothesized relationships among orders and placing many genera for the first time. The validated data set, species tree and all intermediates are openly accessible via the Kew Tree of Life Explorer and will be updated as further data become available. This major milestone toward a complete tree of life for all flowering plant species opens doors to a highly integrated future for angiosperm phylogenomics through the systematic sequencing of standardized nuclear markers. Our approach has the potential to serve as a much-needed bridge between the growing movement to sequence the genomes of all life on Earth and the vast phylogenomic potential of the world\'s natural history collections.
