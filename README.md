## Files for "75 Years of Systematic Biology: Looking Back, Moving Forward"

Based on the shared ideas of [Michael Landis](michael.landis@wustl.edu) and [Michael Donoghue](michael.donoghue@yale.edu).

Organization:
- `syst_biol_analysis.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook with Python code for generating all results in the main text and supplement
- `data/` contains our enhanced dataset and the original dataset from Oxford
- `output/` contains spreadsheets from the topic modeling analysis
- `plot/` contains figures
